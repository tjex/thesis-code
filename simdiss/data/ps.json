Uses a n-gram model to create groupings of functions.\n\n\u003e p. 8 Autonomous pattern generation system explained.\n\n\u003e p. 10 Reduced bloat of generated code, by limiting function selection to\n\u003e functions that were unique, in that they had not yet been seen by the selector\n\u003e algorithm. \n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- Wilson, Elizabeth, Shawn Lawson, Alex McLean, and Jeremy Stewart. “Autonomous\n  Creation of Musical Pattern from Types and Models in Live Coding,” 2021.\n  https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Autonomous-Creation-of-Musical-Pattern-from-Types-Wilson-Lawson/dd9d40e6e7544914c1c22ac4d244aae8947204a6.\n\n",

Bring goodwill to yourself—do not judge\n\u003e yourself or create high expectations and goals. Be patient and kind and gently\n\u003e persevere. When the Three Goodwills are practised with your meditation,\n\u003e meditation becomes just like a dear friend: • you love spending time with it;\n\u003e • you give it your full, loving attention; • you cherish every meeting; and •\n\u003e you treat it with respect and reverence.

PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION  ^ref-19268\n\n\n##### loc: 1794 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e Mindfulness meditation cultivates a state of awareness that is less dominated\n\u003e by thinking, less stimulated by imagination and memory, less active, and more\n\u003e open, receptive and in touch with the aspects of one’s experience that are\n\u003e here and now. Mindfulness practice slows down the forward projection of the\n\u003e thinking mind, which is overly committed to achieving, getting, having,\n\u003e holding and protecting.  ^ref-59379\n\n\n##### loc: 1865 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e But with patience and by persevering with the mindfulness practice, boredom,\n\u003e restlessness and impatience are gradually transformed into feelings of peace\n\u003e and spaciousness.  ^ref-11957\n\n\n##### loc: 1888 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e when you meditate, this may well be another form of resistance to simply\n\u003e ^ref-49608\n\n\n##### loc: 1887 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e If you find yourself frequently becoming sleepy when you meditate, this may\n\u003e well be another form of resistance to simply being in the present moment. It\n\u003e is almost as if we have an on/off switch in our brain and nervous system: when\n\u003e we are busy worrying, judging and planning, the switch is in the on position;\n\u003e when there is nothing to plan, judge or worry about, the switch goes to off\n\u003e and we fall asleep.  ^ref-32935\nDad\n\n##### loc: 1913 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e Remember, with mindfulness, you are not trying to change the contents of your\n\u003e awareness—your thoughts, feelings and sensations. Rather you are simply and\n\u003e profoundly changing your attitude to the contents of your awareness.\n\u003e ^ref-39041\n\n\n##### loc: 1933 (15-10-2019)\n\u003e Paul was taught the Three Goodwills by Lama Thubten Yeshe. They are: 1. Bring\n\u003e goodwill to your meditation teachers. 2. Bring goodwill to the meditation\n\u003e practice—do not try to change, improve or adjust it; keep it simple and\n\u003e ‘surrender’ to its simplicity. 3. Bring goodwill to yourself—do not judge\n\u003e yourself or create high expectations and goals. Be patient and kind and gently\n\u003e persevere. When the Three Goodwills are practised with your meditation,\n\u003e meditation becomes just like a dear friend: • you love spending time with it;\n\u003e • you give it your full, loving attention; • you cherish every meeting; and •\n\u003e you treat it with respect and reverence. In this way, meditation ceases to be\n\u003e a chore or a discipline and becomes, instead, a blessed and special time.\n\u003e ^ref-23503\n\n\n##### loc: 2140 (17-10-2019)\n\u003e Monkey mind is excessive rumination on hopes, wishes, dreams, concerns and\n\u003e worries which habitually recycle through the mind.  ^ref-62691\n\n\n##### loc: 2405 (24-10-2019)\n\u003e The mind withdraws attention from the body and the senses, so excessive\n\u003e thinking is non-sense, i.e. nonsense!

Upon noticing a thought, we do not fight it yet we do not\n\u003e continue to feed it or follow it. We simply open our awareness to include the\n\u003e feeling of our breathing—in other words, we turn our attention back to the\n\u003e breathing and allow the thought to run itself out, to move on through.\n\u003e ^ref-53085\n\n\n##### loc: 2479 (27-10-2019)\n\u003e The fact that thoughts continue to pop into your mind during meditation is not\n\u003e a problem. Each time you notice you have been following thoughts, return to\n\u003e the breathing and silently congratulate yourself for changing the old habit of\n\u003e attention by coming back to the present moment. If you notice yourself\n\u003e following a thought ten times in the space of a minute, then that is ten times\n\u003e you can congratulate yourself—not judge and criticise yourself. Gently\n\u003e persevere.  ^ref-19143\n\n\n##### loc: 2568 (29-10-2019)\n\u003e In the practice script that follows, your attention will be directed to what\n\u003e we call the Four Access Points to body awareness. These are the feet, the\n\u003e tummy, the shoulders and the face.  ^ref-12927\n\n\n##### loc: 2616 (29-10-2019)\n\u003e The true value of body sensations is that they involve no interpretation, no\n\u003e imagination, no judgement.

No need to analyse why you\n\u003e were distracted or to criticise yourself; simply open your awareness, let the\n\u003e thought be and come back to your body sensations. If thoughts about your\n\u003e meditation practice intrude, including concerns about whether or not you are\n\u003e ‘doing it correctly’, or wanting to get somewhere, just notice the\n\u003e thoughts—not feeding them and not fighting them—and see them as words or\n\u003e pictures in the mind. Then simply return your attention to the access point\n\u003e and the flow of your breathing.

Use Active Voice\n    When a sentence includes _be_ or any other copulative verb, such as _is_ or _are_, recast the sentence to omit the verb.\n\n    Don't: “The meeting was seen by us as a ploy to delay the project.”\n    Do: “We saw the meeting as a ploy to delay the project.”\n\n2.  Avoid Vague Nouns\n    Phrases formed around general nouns such as _aspect_, _degree_, and _situation_ clutter sentences.\n\n    Don't: “She is an expert in the area of international relations.”\n    Do: “She is an expert in international relations.”\n\n3.  Use Words, Not Their Definitions\n    Replace explanatory phrases with a single word that encapsulates that explanation.\n\n    Don't: “The crops also needed to be marketable so that families would be able to sell any yields that exceeded what they personally required.”\n    Do: “The crops also needed to be marketable so that families would be able to sell any surplus.”\n\n4.  Avoid Noun Strings\n    Reorganize sentences to eliminate series of nouns used as adjectives.\n\n    Don't: “The lack of a secure transfer may hamper computer security incident response efforts.”\n    Do: “The lack of a secure transfer may hamper responses to computer-security incidents.”\n\n5.  Convert Nouns to Verbs\n    When a sentence includes a noun ending in _-tion_, change the noun to a verb to simplify the sentence.\n\n    Don't: “They will collaborate in the creation of new guidelines.”\n    Do: “They will collaborate to create new guidelines.”\n\n    or en example without a _-tion_:\n\n    Don't: “This paragraph provides a conclusion of the description”\n    Do: “This paragraph concludes the description”\n\n6.  Reduce Verb Phrases to Simple Verbs\n    Identify the verb buried in a verb phrase and omit the rest of the phrase.\n\n    Don't: “The results are suggestive of the fact that tampering has occurred.”\n    Do: “The results suggest that tampering has occurred.”\n\n7.  Replace Complex Words with Simple Ones\n    Choose simpler synonyms for multisyllabic words. I am not sure I agree with this - it is up to your personal style.\n\n    Don't: “The department will disseminate the forms soon.”\n    Do: “The department will pass out the forms soon.”\n\n8.  Avoid Expletives\n    Don’t start sentences with “There is,” “There are,” or “It is.”\n\n    Don't: “There are many factors in the product’s failure.”\n    Do: “Many factors contributed to the product’s failure.”\n\n9.  Eliminate Prepositional Phrases Replace “(noun1) of the (noun2)” phrasing with “(noun2)’s (noun1)” phrasing.\n\n    Don't: “The decision of the committee is final.”\n    Do: “The committee’s decision is final.”\n\n10. Reduce Wordy Phrases to Single Words\n    Replace phrases that signal a transition with simple conjunctions, verbs, or other linking words.\n\n## More Dos and Donts\n\nDon't: Due to the fact that the project is behind schedule, today’s meeting has been postponed.\n**Do:** Because the project is behind schedule, today’s meeting has been postponed.\n\nDon't: “The meeting was seen as a ploy to delay the project.”\n**Do:** “We saw the meeting as a ploy to delay the project.”\nBut don’t do this: “We then sort the vertices by height…”.

We see this in the way different cultures and societies\nengage with the internet. This comes through historical cultural values as well\nas socio-economic factors, which includes internet access, speeds, consumer\nhardware, free time to spend online and governmental control.\n\nImportance is placed on the value of understanding the internet as a shared\ndevelopment rather than a singular technological entity born from the US.\n\n\u003e p. 2 The spread and adoption of the internet has been documented differently\n\u003e by different cultures.\n\n\u003e p.3 Once learned, infrastructures become invisible until they break or falter,\n\u003e after which they are painfully visible again.  \n\n\u003e p. 4 Cybersyn was a nationally networked computer infrastructure in Chile\n\u003e 1971. It existed before ARPANET and shows that the internet is not a\n\u003e technology that exclusively comes from the US. \n\n\u003e p.3 Stating that online communities are largely formed out of privilege of\n\u003e free time and money for paid memberships. This is a bit out of touch. Back in\n\u003e the day, this was the case for sure. But in the modern day, I would argue\n\u003e (without having any qualitative proof) that it's he upper classes that will\n\u003e spend less time online as they have more money to enjoy sports, events, trips\n\u003e away and other such entertainments.

(Re)defining Internet histories\"\ndate: 2023-04-01\npeople: [H.Abbate]\ntag: [text, essay]\n---\n\nAn essay about \"the strengths and limitations of three broad ways of framing\nInternet histories.\" These are a singular technical entity, born from ARPANET\n(the US), an occurrence of many smaller systems independent of each other and a\nsystem of governance and control. \n\nIt's argued that the internet is a cultural artefact as much as it is a\ntechnological system. We see this in the way different cultures and societies\nengage with the internet. This comes through historical cultural values as well\nas socio-economic factors, which includes internet access, speeds, consumer\nhardware, free time to spend online and governmental control.\n\nImportance is placed on the value of understanding the internet as a shared\ndevelopment rather than a singular technological entity born from the US.\n\n\u003e p. 2 The spread and adoption of the internet has been documented differently\n\u003e by different cultures.\n\n\u003e p.3 Once learned, infrastructures become invisible until they break or falter,\n\u003e after which they are painfully visible again.  \n\n\u003e p. 4 Cybersyn was a nationally networked computer infrastructure in Chile\n\u003e 1971. It existed before ARPANET and shows that the internet is not a\n\u003e technology that exclusively comes from the US. \n\n\u003e p.3 Stating that online communities are largely formed out of privilege of\n\u003e free time and money for paid memberships. This is a bit out of touch. Back in\n\u003e the day, this was the case for sure. But in the modern day, I would argue\n\u003e (without having any qualitative proof) that it's he upper classes that will\n\u003e spend less time online as they have more money to enjoy sports, events, trips\n\u003e away and other such entertainments. They may well still be on their phones\n\u003e during that time, but the critical mass have a smartphone now. \n\n\u003e p. 5 The geographical coverage of the internet follows patterns of power\n\u003e disparities. Something that [James Bridle](../g/5m5r) writes about in [New Dark Age - James Bridle](7gt0). \n\n\u003e p. 6 To see the internet as a collection of local systems interfaced together,\n\u003e is to see the internet as multiple.

    "body": "## Vipassana\n\nVipassana is the original, unaltered meditation technique of \"The Buddha\" (as we were\ntaught, any enlightened person is Buddha), Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practice\nof meditation that is universal in that everyone has access to it. You don't\nneed to pay someone to provide you with your own special mantra (no access for\nthe poor), to visualise an image (no access for the blind), or to sit or move\nin any particular way (no access for physically challenged). The technique is\ngrounded in experiencing the present moment through observation of bodily\nsensations, something that everyone has access to [^1].\n\nThe following is my understanding of the philosophies of Vipassana meditation\nand how they interface with our daily life and nature as a whole.\nAs context, you can read a text [here](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/art) based on a\ntalk by [S.N Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/goenka), who was a leader\nin the teaching of Vipassana from 1969-2013. \n\nI comment a little bit on the ten day course I completed in June 2023, but in\nkeeping with the correct way of introducing people to the course - I do not\nwant to influence too much or create too much of an image.\n\nThe TL;DR for the Vipassana course itself is that it was mentally and\nphysically challenging but very educational and rewarding. The two advices I would give is 1)\nanyone considering to undertake a course should first establish a \npractice of regular mindfulness meditation and be comfortable to sit on the ground\nwith legs crossed. This is more so that you can take best advantage of the\nunique experience and environment of a Vipassana course, and not have to spend\nall your time battling physical discomfort. And 2) to just wait until you feel like it's \na good time to do it. There's no need to rush. It will pay off much more if it's done \nwhen it wants to be done.\n\n## The Retreat\n\nI did my course in Sweden at [Dhamma Sobhana](https://sobhana.dhamma.org/).\nThe environment was a manifestation of tranquility itself. To be found were\nwell kept gardens, small forest areas with varieties of beautiful flowers,\nwinding paths and cosy red cottages with white outlines. Time is defined by the\nsoft striking of two gongs. One for the male students, another for the female,\na perfect fourth interval apart, creating a slowly phasing ambient rhythm that\nis heard anywhere in the compound. Beds are comfortable, food is wholesome and\namenities just fine. \n\nThe noble silence was an interesting and special experience. On the arrival\nday, you meet everyone and can get to know each other, then from 20:00 the\nnoble silence begins. The nine days that follow you may not talk or communicate\nwith other students in any way. No gesturing, writing or signalling. This helps\na lot with being able to stay in the meditational focus and frame of mind\nrequired to make the meditation sessions more fluid. It also reduces the mental\nfriction that can occur if students compare their experiences with each other\nthroughout the week. This can lead to comparison between ones self and others,\nwhich has no useful place in meditational practice at all. The meditation is\nyour experience. The yard stick is your equanimity. \n\nThe most profound thing about the silence though is, upon the last day when the\nsilence is lifted, how much more you know each other despite not having talked\nsince day one. Everyone feels like close friends. This no doubt comes through\nthe sharing of the challenging experience, and living in close quarters with\neach other. It was very interesting to experience how a strong sense of solidarity \nand friendship can still occur in near total lack of communication, vocal or otherwise. \n\nI considered a few times that it could be an interesting exercise for teams of \nsoftware developers to spend some days (maybe not ten) in a retreat, where they cannot \ncommunicate with each other at all, but need to live together and also work on a programming \ntask. The value would lie in the interpersonal and social developments that come from a form \nof interaction that is outside of the normal and mundane (like the uncomfortable exercise \nof two people being tasked to stare for two minutes directly into each others eyes without \naverting their gazes. Anyone who's done this, realises a strange sense of 'knowing' the person afterward, \ndespite having exchanged no words). \n\nVipassana retreats can be anywhere from three days to fourty-five. Ten days \nis the standard and recommended length. During these ten days, you essentially \nlive the life of a monk or nun. You don't speak, you eat the food that is prepared \nfor you and you follow a set schedule of meditation and break times. \n\nIt's demanding, physically and mentally. Eleven hours meditation every day\nrequires the body to be accustomed to sitting on the floor without unbearable\nor increasing discomfort. And to focus continuously for ten days is strenuous\nin of itself, despite the focus not being on an analytical task. You do\nencounter then, a form of mental exhaustion, and it's made worse when you\nindulge in questioning how many days are left and how difficult will those days\nincreasingly be. But this is just as much part of the practice. To disengage\nfrom those thoughts of aversion and craving, and the tension they bring, and to\nreturn to the true reality of you being where you are, moment to moment.\n\n## The Technique\n\nOn the forth day the main Vipassana technique, Pañña, is taught. It's the\npractice of observing sensations in the body and remaining equanimous with\nthem. This means to not judge them as being pleasurable or unpleasurable,\ndesirable or undesirable, wanted or unwanted. By practicing this equanimity,\nthe behavioural pattern of the mind, which seeks to generate craving (pleasure)\nand aversion (displeasure), becomes weakened. The generation of craving or\naversion leads to attachment; we become attached to something desirable\nhappening, or something undesirable not happening. When the opposite happens,\nand what we want to happen does not eventuate, we encounter misery. \n\nWith this, Buddha concluded that craving and aversion are the root cause of all\nmisery and to become fully enlightened, one must rid themselves of all craving\nand aversion. At this point, a lot of people get demotivated from the\nphilosophy. *This is a path only for some*. The rest of us can move somewhere\nalong the path and stop at whatever point is sustainable. That is the best\ncollective result for society. It does not need to be all or nothing. You \ncan still have sex (even with yourself), or do \u003cinsert naughty thing\u003e. The idea \nis to become a *better* person, not to become Buddha. You can actually bake the cake \nand eat it too in this case, you just wont assimilate into the universe.\n\nVipassana teaches that each and every reaction we elicit, mental or physical,\nbegins with a sensation in the body. The sensations in the body arise from the\nunconscious mind, that is its domain; the autonomous faculties of mind and\nmatter. By training ourselves to calm our outer layer, the conscious mind, and\nto maintain awareness of bodily sensations as they rise and pass away, we are\ntraining an ability to integrate an awareness into our every day life. When we\nsubsequently find ourselves in any situation, and we have a good practice of\nVipassana established (being equanimous), we can become aware of a sensation in\nthe body as they occur. With the awareness of that sensation, we can then react\nmore wisely than we otherwise would, as our reactions otherwise would be just\nthat - reactions, not considerations. \n\n## Anicca, The Law of Impermanence\n\nFrom this comes the emergence of a compassion for all life an all beings,\nbecause all life, including ourselves, exists within the same universal law of\nimpermanence. All things change. Because all things change, all things are\nimpermanent, ultimate truth cannot exist in the generation of craving or\naversion. Craving *can* remain permanent, as can aversion. They feed themselves\nand only grow more hungry. This is incongruous with the universal law of\nimpermanence. It places you on a divergent path to that of true nature, which\nultimately generates misery for you, as you are diverging yourself from nature.  \n\nGenerating craving or aversion (sankahra) is the process of desiring reality to\nbe something it is not. Vipassana teaches the practitioner to observe reality\nas it is, which brings tranquility and peace to the experience of reality. This\ndoes not mean that we can't desire things. Or that if we desire things or want\nthings to be different, that we will only generate misery. Of course in\nessence, it does work this way and becomes clearer when you take the extreme as\nan example: If you always desire a different reality than your own, then your\nreality will be misery, because day after day, year after year it is not what\nyou want. This is a disease that plagues many people who are focussed on\ngenerating wealth and power for the sake of wealth and power. It leads to never\nbeing satisfied, because there is always more to be had. Drug addiction\nworks the same, it's just the object of the craving is different. \n\nWe can still desire things, and to be excited about things eventuating. **The\nmeasure of how much misery this brings to your life is how much tension you\nexperience waiting for the thing to eventuate and how equanimous you remain\nwhen that desire does not eventuate.** If you experience no tension while\nwaiting for the thing to eventuate; meaning you are present in each moment up\nuntil it eventuates or not, and if you do not react with frustration, anger,\ndisappointment or such when it does not eventuate; then you are living a life\ncloser to real peace and harmony. A life of equanimity. \n\nPure Vipassana theory would say that you should also not experience elation or\neuphoria when the thing *does* occur. On the outset, this does not sound\nappropriate. However, feeling elation, euphoria or other such extreme\n\"positive\" feelings, are the *result* of a craving being satisfied. If you were\nto feel elation, euphoria or such feelings when the thing eventuates, you would\nequally feel devastation, anger, resentment or such feelings if it did not\neventuate. With each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n\n## A Sense of Realism?\n\nIt is however important to remember that nature and life could not exist\nwithout sankahra. Reproduction is fuelled by sankahra. Nature is perfect, but\nalso imperfect. It is cruel and kind. We can also not simply conclude that a\nlife completely void of sankahra which an enlightened person achieves, should\nbe hailed as the true destination of happiness and prosperity for all humans. If all\nhumans achieved this, we would stop reproducing. It would be an extinction\nevent. However, it would arguably be better for all other beings and plants\non earth if humans became extinct. Everything else suffers by our existence (except \nviruses). \n\nThe paradox here I suppose is that if all humans did become enlightened, no one\nwould have a problem with the human race becoming extinct within a generation,\nas we would all be one with nature anyway. We would be totally and collectively\nat peace with death and the ultimate truth of nature, meaning we would not be\ncompelled to reproduce - a partial process of immortalising ourselves by passing\nfragments of ourselves down to our children. \n\nAt this point it is theory. Just reading the concepts can never lead to an\naccurate conclusion of its truth. It needs to be experienced itself. And this\ncomes full circle to the essence of the Vipassana technique being a universal\ntruth. It is a practice that is universally true for each and every human\nbeing. The practice is to experience one's own reality as it is, not as one\nwishes it to be. There is no exclusivity in the accessibility to this truth or\nultimately to enlightenment. It is universal, and nature is universal. No one\nis more or less resultant from nature than anyone else. Anyone can experience\nthe benefits of Vipassana because everyone has universal access to the truth of\nnature through the manifestation of sensations of the body.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is different from other modifications of the technique\nsuch as transcendental meditation, which requires the practitioner be given a\nmantra. A special and supposedly unique word, which only a guru can give. The\nprovision of this mantra, carries the burden of secrecy whereby the\npractitioner cannot reveal the mantra to anyone else, or else the mantra will\nloose its essence. While using the mantra as a source of focus for meditation\ndoes calm and focus the mind, it does not allow the practitioner to access the\npure truth of themselves and their place in nature. This is because they are\nthemselves generating an alternate reality for themselves by repeating a secret\nword. This by definition is *not* a universal truth. If each practitioner of\ntranscendental meditation is given a unique word, then each practitioner is\nexperiencing a reality that is divergent from their true reality when they\nmeditate, the reality as it is, not as they (through repetition of mantra) wish\nit to be. By diverging from nature in a meditational practice, one can never\ntruly access nature at its core. Only the surface, a calming of the mind and an\nenhanced focus, will be reached. \n\n\n[^1] I did some research for cases where people may lose the ability to perceive \nall perception of sensations in the body, but did not find anything. Only partial loss in sensation. \nIf I'm wrong, please email me!",

We would be totally and collectively\nat peace with death and the ultimate truth of nature, meaning we would not be\ncompelled to reproduce - a partial process of immortalising ourselves by passing\nfragments of ourselves down to our children. \n\nAt this point it is theory. Just reading the concepts can never lead to an\naccurate conclusion of its truth. It needs to be experienced itself. And this\ncomes full circle to the essence of the Vipassana technique being a universal\ntruth. It is a practice that is universally true for each and every human\nbeing. The practice is to experience one's own reality as it is, not as one\nwishes it to be. There is no exclusivity in the accessibility to this truth or\nultimately to enlightenment. It is universal, and nature is universal. No one\nis more or less resultant from nature than anyone else. Anyone can experience\nthe benefits of Vipassana because everyone has universal access to the truth of\nnature through the manifestation of sensations of the body.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is different from other modifications of the technique\nsuch as transcendental meditation, which requires the practitioner be given a\nmantra. A special and supposedly unique word, which only a guru can give. The\nprovision of this mantra, carries the burden of secrecy whereby the\npractitioner cannot reveal the mantra to anyone else, or else the mantra will\nloose its essence. While using the mantra as a source of focus for meditation\ndoes calm and focus the mind, it does not allow the practitioner to access the\npure truth of themselves and their place in nature. This is because they are\nthemselves generating an alternate reality for themselves by repeating a secret\nword. This by definition is *not* a universal truth. If each practitioner of\ntranscendental meditation is given a unique word, then each practitioner is\nexperiencing a reality that is divergent from their true reality when they\nmeditate, the reality as it is, not as they (through repetition of mantra) wish\nit to be. By diverging from nature in a meditational practice, one can never\ntruly access nature at its core. Only the surface, a calming of the mind and an\nenhanced focus, will be reached. \n\n\n[^1] I did some research for cases where people may lose the ability to perceive \nall perception of sensations in the body, but did not find anything. Only partial loss in sensation. \nIf I'm wrong, please email me!\n",
