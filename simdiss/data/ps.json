Coined by Joan Robinson.\n\n\u003e Few people are willing to spend twelve hours on an assembly line or grappling\n\u003e with bookkeeping without being paid for their trouble. However, humans are\n\u003e driven to create, even when there’s no prospect of any financial return.\n\nWhy creators pen themselves up to being taken advantage of.\n\n\u003e But while capitalism does remain the dominant economic and political system,\n\u003e we should be doing everything we can to promote competitive conditions—not\n\u003e just allowing those who already have wealth and power to extract ever more.\n\nPromoting competition is what stabalises capitalist syste. Is it also why open\nsource maintains its good nature?\n\n\u003e In fact, giving more copyright to creators who are struggling against powerful\n\u003e buyers is like giving more lunch money to your bullied kid. The bullies who\n\u003e were taking his money every day will just take that too. The upshot? The\n\u003e bullies now have enough money to pay the principal to look the other way, and\n\u003e your kid still goes hungry.\n\nKiller analogy.\n\n\u003e Productivity rose by more than 75 percent, but average pay by just 5 percent\n\nSince 1980\n\n## CHAPTER 2 How Amazon Took Over Books\n\n\u003e This gives corporations the power to make up their own private laws and have\n\u003e them enforced by public courts and the police.\n\nDRM provides a system for companies to control not just their customers, but\ntheir vendors as well. It effectively strips away the aspect of corporate\ncompetition based on maintaining customers and vendors with a good product and\nservice.\n\n\u003e By insisting on DRM, the record labels made Steve Jobs a powerful gatekeeper\n\u003e between themselves and their customers.\n\nDRM backfired on the record labels.\n\n\u003e Amazon’s web services division (AWS), which controls almost half the world’s\n\u003e public cloud infrastructure, also gives it a bird’s-eye view of emerging\n\u003e start-ups, which enables it to detect threats early and makes it even harder\n\u003e for potential competitors to reach the scale they need to compete\n\nThe eye of Amazon\n\n\u003e HP used it to plant a time bomb in its printers, which prevented printing with\n\u003e any cartridges that had been refilled or supplied by third parties.\n\nThis and many other good examples here.\n\n\u003e Random House tried to create its own app, but Apple refused to approve it\n\nApple blocked to app of Radom House after they did not accept Apples ebook\ndistri ution deal\n\n\u003e They told Amazon they were willing to let it sell their titles as ebooks, but\n\u003e only on the condition that they be wrapped in DRM. With that, they handed\n\u003e Amazon the keys to their castles\n\nDRM reduces competition between distributors, and as capitalism runs its due\ncourse, there will be one distributor to rule them all.\n\n\u003e the BUY buttons had been removed from every Melville House book on Amazon\n\nAmazon literaly removed the buybutton from all books of Melville House sown the\nproof behind the sum that Amazon were demanding.\n\n\u003e This is the true heart of “surveillance capitalism”—not the idea that Big Tech\n\u003e uses data-mining and machine learning to create mind-control systems that\n\u003e bypass our critical faculties and trick us into buying whatever they want to\n\u003e sell us. Rather, Big Tech abuses monopoly power to deprive us of choice by\n\u003e limiting what we can buy, redirecting our searches to hide rivals’ products,\n\u003e and locking us into its ecosystem with technologies we can’t alter without\n\u003e risking a lengthy prison sentence\n\nThe true function of suerveillance capitalism\n\n## CHAPTER 3 How News Got Broken\n\n\u003e Take Facebook’s video numbers for example. In 2014 it began providing\n\u003e advertisers with data about how long users spent watching videos. What it\n\u003e didn’t mention was that, in making that calculation, it ignored every view\n\u003e that lasted fewer than three seconds. This had the effect of inflating viewing\n\u003e times by at least 60–80 percent (according to Facebook, when it eventually\n\u003e copped to the con) and up to 900\n\nThe platform also straight up conning advertisers\n\n\u003e But Craigslist’s CEO Jim Buckmaster has consistently described the site as a\n\u003e public service. “We’re not interested in selling our users short in order to\n\u003e try to become insanely wealthy.”1\n\nLegend\n\n\u003e She points out that Google dominates ad markets via conduct that would be\n\u003e illegal in other trading markets: “Google’s exchange shares superior trading\n\u003e information and speed with the Google-owned intermediaries, Google steers buy\n\u003e and sell orders to its exchange and websites (Search and YouTube), and Google\n\u003e abuses its access to inside information.”\n\nToo big to fail, too big to jail? Dina Srinivasan\n\n\u003e 80 percent of the annual spend, was attributable to fraud\n\nUbers ad expenditure could be cut 80 percent with no effect on conversions. They\nwere scammed by marketers who attained data from apps that had root access. When\n[Uber](../g/x8rx) was installed, they would register that a customer had been\nconverted through a click advertisement, when in fact 80 percent of those\ninstalls were through organic channels.\n\n\u003e The ad system has built-in layers of misdirection because the people profiting\n\u003e most don’t want you to recognize it for the shell game it is.\n\nWhy its so hard to uncover fraudulant ad behaviours.\n\n\u003e This revenue hole is disastrous on any number of fronts. For democracy,\n\u003e because there are so few commercial resources remaining to fund investigative\n\u003e journalism and scrutinize government, enabling corruption and waste to\n\u003e flourish. For the arts, because there’s little ability to cover any but the\n\u003e biggest books and productions\n\nsqueezed margins means a desparation to attract more viewers. This increasingly\nmeans more clickbait, sensationalist media, huge pop acts and lies as seen with\nFox news in 2023.\n\n\u003e Overwhelmingly, it’s extremely recent data that drives the most valuable\n\u003e targeting.\n\nGoogle and Facebook sell a brittle lie that their data histories of users offer\nunbeatable ad targeting.\n\n\u003e More and more news, insofar as it’s still covered at all, is generated by AI\n\u003e without human involvement. About a third of Bloomberg News’s content is\n\u003e generated by a robot reporter.\n\nAI reporting is partially a response to drastically reduced margins from being\nbeholden to internet monopsoies.\n\n## CHAPTER 4 Why Prince Changed His Name\n\n\u003e But as the new art form grew in popularity and began to make money, the labels\n\u003e who owned the copyrights in the sampled recordings began demanding a cut\n\nwas it just the labels who cared? or the artists too?\n\n\u003e Increasingly, though, artists who signed up with labels found that their\n\u003e contracts expropriated them of future sample revenues by mandating that any\n\u003e revenue would be offset against those all-but-undischargeable debts for the\n\u003e costs of recording their records. The new sampling revenue went straight to\n\u003e the label.\n\nLabels simply made contracts to claim sampling royalties too.\n\n## CHAPTER 12 Ideas Lying Around\n\n\u003e There are three core ways interventions outside of antitrust can help: by\n\u003e encouraging new entrants, by directly regulating buyer power, and by building\n\u003e up countervailing power in workers and suppliers\n\nThree main interventions apart from antitrust to reign in chokepoint capitalism\n\n\u003e Robert Bork and the Chicago crew forced upon us a great forgetting, shattering\n\u003e our capacity to rein corporate power in.\n\nSounds like a raith\n\n\u003e No less a person than Milton Friedman—the archduke of neoliberalism—recognized\n\u003e the transformative potential of ideas ready to be used.\n\nAnother raith\n\n\u003e Instead, consumerism became a way to shift the blame for harms caused by\n\u003e large, profiteering firms onto their customers: if you don’t like climate\n\u003e change, get rid of your car!

Each version of DOS was\n\u003e subtly tweaked to favor Excel over Lotus, and the company’s unofficial motto\n\u003e was “DOS isn’t done until Lotus won’t run.”\n\n\u003e We could have it if the US Congress would enact an “interoperator’s defense”\n\u003e shielding people from all liability, under any cause of action, if they could\n\u003e demonstrate they were modifying an existing product or service to improve its\n\u003e security or accessibility, to repair it, to add otherwise lawful features to\n\u003e it, or to help bona fide users of the system shift legitimately purchased\n\u003e digital products to a competing service.\n\none concise idea for interop law.\n\n\u003e In our changing world, repair laws are increasingly important. As explained by\n\u003e Aaron Perzanowski in The Right to Repair, repairing goods doesn’t just help us\n\u003e save money and reduce the environmental costs of the consumer lifestyle. It\n\u003e also “helps us grow and flourish as people. Through repair, we become better\n\u003e informed about the world around us, develop analytical and problem-solving\n\u003e skills, exercise greater autonomy, and build stronger communities.”\n\nrepair laws are important for theabove reasoning. Included in this is the need\nfor absence of DRM and the presence of open source. Thrugh this we can mktigate\nalot of our problems.\n\n\u003e State legislatures have another powerful tool at their disposal: procurement.\n\nGovernment soul use its buying power to only buy from companies, technology that\nis interoperable - or who contracturally promise to make it so.\n\n\u003e In August 2021, South Korea became the first country to outlaw app store\n\u003e operators from forcing use of their own payment systems, with similar\n\u003e interventions also being actively considered elsewhere.8 Just days later, the\n\u003e US court charged with resolving the litigation between Epic Games and Apple\n\u003e issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Apple from stopping app developers\n\u003e from linking to their own purchase mechanisms. That explicitly widens out the\n\u003e chokepoint: sellers of music, video, and books will finally be able to offer\n\u003e users ways to subscribe and buy while bypassing Apple’s cut\n\nExample source","snippets":["# Chokepoint Capitalism"],"rawContent":"---\ntitle: Chokepoint Capitalism\ndate: 2023-04-01\ntags: [book]\n---\n\n# Chokepoint Capitalism\n\n## CHAPTER 1 Big Business Captured Culture\n\n\u003e those jobs can be done from home, they can be done from the Philippines, or\n\u003e Estonia, or anywhere else with a reasonably reliable connection to the\n\u003e internet.\n\nCovid changed the industries understanding of the white collar workforce.\n\n\u003e “It’s striking, when one pauses to think about it, how essential art and\n\u003e culture remain to the digital economy even as most of the money floating\n\u003e around goes to multibillion-dollar businesses that don’t invest much in\n\u003e either,” Astra Taylor points out in The People’s Platform.\n\nArt and culture drive digital economies, and yet they're not invested in\napprpriate to their value.\n\n\u003e While competition is supposed to be central to capitalism, the wealthiest\n\u003e people alive today have gotten rich by suppressing it\n\nCapitalism only works when competition can be maintained.\n\n\u003e Ruth Towse\n\nCultural economist who studies creative labor markets\n\n\u003e Among other dubious practices, Amazon uses its inside knowledge to track the\n\u003e sales of third-party vendors to identify the most profitable products, then\n\u003e clones those products and puts them up for sale, undercutting the vendors\n\u003e whose vision and investment built the markets for them in the first place.\n\nCunts\n\n\u003e That’s why it has a blanket ban on its staff using phrases like “network\n\u003e effects” and “barriers to entry”\n\nGoogle controls the language its employers use to maintain false arratives.\nAnother \"special military operation\".\n\n\u003e Monopoly was viewed as a threat to the very idea of democratic citizenship\n\nHow times change...\n\n\u003e Companies always pinkie swear their mergers will result in lower prices, but\n\u003e analyses done after the fact show again and again that prices actually go\n\u003e up—especially when the merger is in an already concentrated market\n\nPrices go up after mergers\n\n\u003e This great tilting of the playing field, away from workers and toward owners,\n\u003e has a variety of causes, but the biggest is a radical theory of antitrust,\n\u003e driven by jurist and far-right cult-of-personality darling Robert Bork and\n\u003e exported by his disciples at the Chicago school of economics\n\nThe imbalance between corporations and creators is in large the fault of Robert\nBork\n\n\u003e What’s less examined or understood is how chokepoints create monopsony power.\n\u003e While monopolies occur when sellers have power over buyers, monopsonies are\n\u003e when buyers have power over sellers\n\nConcept: Monopsony. Coined by Joan Robinson.\n\n\u003e Few people are willing to spend twelve hours on an assembly line or grappling\n\u003e with bookkeeping without being paid for their trouble. However, humans are\n\u003e driven to create, even when there’s no prospect of any financial return.\n\nWhy creators pen themselves up to being taken advantage of.\n\n\u003e But while capitalism does remain the dominant economic and political system,\n\u003e we should be doing everything we can to promote competitive conditions—not\n\u003e just allowing those who already have wealth and power to extract ever more.\n\nPromoting competition is what stabalises capitalist syste. Is it also why open\nsource maintains its good nature?\n\n\u003e In fact, giving more copyright to creators who are struggling against powerful\n\u003e buyers is like giving more lunch money to your bullied kid. The bullies who\n\u003e were taking his money every day will just take that too. The upshot? The\n\u003e bullies now have enough money to pay the principal to look the other way, and\n\u003e your kid still goes hungry.\n\nKiller analogy.\n\n\u003e Productivity rose by more than 75 percent, but average pay by just 5 percent\n\nSince 1980\n\n## CHAPTER 2 How Amazon Took Over Books\n\n\u003e This gives corporations the power to make up their own private laws and have\n\u003e them enforced by public courts and the police.\n\nDRM provides a system for companies to control not just their customers, but\ntheir vendors as well. It effectively strips away the aspect of corporate\ncompetition based on maintaining customers and vendors with a good product and\nservice.\n\n\u003e By insisting on DRM, the record labels made Steve Jobs a powerful gatekeeper\n\u003e between themselves and their customers.\n\nDRM backfired on the record labels.\n\n\u003e Amazon’s web services division (AWS), which controls almost half the world’s\n\u003e public cloud infrastructure, also gives it a bird’s-eye view of emerging\n\u003e start-ups, which enables it to detect threats early and makes it even harder\n\u003e for potential competitors to reach the scale they need to compete\n\nThe eye of Amazon\n\n\u003e HP used it to plant a time bomb in its printers, which prevented printing with\n\u003e any cartridges that had been refilled or supplied by third parties.\n\nThis and many other good examples here.\n\n\u003e Random House tried to create its own app, but Apple refused to approve it\n\nApple blocked to app of Radom House after they did not accept Apples ebook\ndistri ution deal\n\n\u003e They told Amazon they were willing to let it sell their titles as ebooks, but\n\u003e only on the condition that they be wrapped in DRM. With that, they handed\n\u003e Amazon the keys to their castles\n\nDRM reduces competition between distributors, and as capitalism runs its due\ncourse, there will be one distributor to rule them all.\n\n\u003e the BUY buttons had been removed from every Melville House book on Amazon\n\nAmazon literaly removed the buybutton from all books of Melville House sown the\nproof behind the sum that Amazon were demanding.\n\n\u003e This is the true heart of “surveillance capitalism”—not the idea that Big Tech\n\u003e uses data-mining and machine learning to create mind-control systems that\n\u003e bypass our critical faculties and trick us into buying whatever they want to\n\u003e sell us. Rather, Big Tech abuses monopoly power to deprive us of choice by\n\u003e limiting what we can buy, redirecting our searches to hide rivals’ products,\n\u003e and locking us into its ecosystem with technologies we can’t alter without\n\u003e risking a lengthy prison sentence\n\nThe true function of suerveillance capitalism\n\n## CHAPTER 3 How News Got Broken\n\n\u003e Take Facebook’s video numbers for example. In 2014 it began providing\n\u003e advertisers with data about how long users spent watching videos. What it\n\u003e didn’t mention was that, in making that calculation, it ignored every view\n\u003e that lasted fewer than three seconds. This had the effect of inflating viewing\n\u003e times by at least 60–80 percent (according to Facebook, when it eventually\n\u003e copped to the con) and up to 900\n\nThe platform also straight up conning advertisers\n\n\u003e But Craigslist’s CEO Jim Buckmaster has consistently described the site as a\n\u003e public service. “We’re not interested in selling our users short in order to\n\u003e try to become insanely wealthy.”1\n\nLegend\n\n\u003e She points out that Google dominates ad markets via conduct that would be\n\u003e illegal in other trading markets: “Google’s exchange shares superior trading\n\u003e information and speed with the Google-owned intermediaries, Google steers buy\n\u003e and sell orders to its exchange and websites (Search and YouTube), and Google\n\u003e abuses its access to inside information.”\n\nToo big to fail, too big to jail? Dina Srinivasan\n\n\u003e 80 percent of the annual spend, was attributable to fraud\n\nUbers ad expenditure could be cut 80 percent with no effect on conversions. They\nwere scammed by marketers who attained data from apps that had root access. When\n[Uber](../g/x8rx) was installed, they would register that a customer had been\nconverted through a click advertisement, when in fact 80 percent of those\ninstalls were through organic channels.\n\n\u003e The ad system has built-in layers of misdirection because the people profiting\n\u003e most don’t want you to recognize it for the shell game it is.\n\nWhy its so hard to uncover fraudulant ad behaviours.\n\n\u003e This revenue hole is disastrous on any number of fronts. For democracy,\n\u003e because there are so few commercial resources remaining to fund investigative\n\u003e journalism and scrutinize government, enabling corruption and waste to\n\u003e flourish. For the arts, because there’s little ability to cover any but the\n\u003e biggest books and productions\n\nsqueezed margins means a desparation to attract more viewers. This increasingly\nmeans more clickbait, sensationalist media, huge pop acts and lies as seen with\nFox news in 2023.\n\n\u003e Overwhelmingly, it’s extremely recent data that drives the most valuable\n\u003e targeting.\n\nGoogle and Facebook sell a brittle lie that their data histories of users offer\nunbeatable ad targeting.\n\n\u003e More and more news, insofar as it’s still covered at all, is generated by AI\n\u003e without human involvement. About a third of Bloomberg News’s content is\n\u003e generated by a robot reporter.\n\nAI reporting is partially a response to drastically reduced margins from being\nbeholden to internet monopsoies.\n\n## CHAPTER 4 Why Prince Changed His Name\n\n\u003e But as the new art form grew in popularity and began to make money, the labels\n\u003e who owned the copyrights in the sampled recordings began demanding a cut\n\nwas it just the labels who cared? or the artists too?\n\n\u003e Increasingly, though, artists who signed up with labels found that their\n\u003e contracts expropriated them of future sample revenues by mandating that any\n\u003e revenue would be offset against those all-but-undischargeable debts for the\n\u003e costs of recording their records. The new sampling revenue went straight to\n\u003e the label.\n\nLabels simply made contracts to claim sampling royalties too.\n\n## CHAPTER 12 Ideas Lying Around\n\n\u003e There are three core ways interventions outside of antitrust can help: by\n\u003e encouraging new entrants, by directly regulating buyer power, and by building\n\u003e up countervailing power in workers and suppliers\n\nThree main interventions apart from antitrust to reign in chokepoint capitalism\n\n\u003e Robert Bork and the Chicago crew forced upon us a great forgetting, shattering\n\u003e our capacity to rein corporate power in.\n\nSounds like a raith\n\n\u003e No less a person than Milton Friedman—the archduke of neoliberalism—recognized\n\u003e the transformative potential of ideas ready to be used.\n\nAnother raith\n\n\u003e Instead, consumerism became a way to shift the blame for harms caused by\n\u003e large, profiteering firms onto their customers: if you don’t like climate\n\u003e change, get rid of your car! (Which would be great, if the monopolized auto\n\u003e sector hadn’t used its excess profits to lobby against public transit.)\n\nConsumers are blamed for the ramifications of their actions. But they have been\nundermined from the beginning. Our money paid for the reduction ocf our free\nwill in a market.\n\n\u003e Rather than seeing ourselves as citizens who deserve a say in how our society\n\u003e is structured, we’ve been urged to view ourselves as consumers, a kind of\n\u003e ambulatory wallet whose influence on society extends only to a series of\n\u003e buy/don’t buy decisions\n\nA shift in how we as a society of people see ourselves\n\n\u003e And we see how it’s actually driving corporate concentration: when you act in\n\u003e concert with rivals it makes you an illegal cartel, but if you buy your\n\u003e rivals, you can do what you like.\n\nLack of antitrust regulation actually enables a behaviour that is worse than\nwhat is illegal.\n\n\u003e If we want to change the world, we have to fix the system.

He became at\nleast mildley corrupt.\n\n\u003e social, economic, cultural, and political interactions, yet few people inside\n\u003e government understand its emerging policy problems well.\n\n^873073\n\nTruth\n\n\u003e The problem is not the plurality of information sources or even the\n\u003e trustworthiness of some of them. It is that we rely too heavily on computers\n\u003e for information, discourse, and connection.\n\nWhy does sourcing truth from technologies degrade the integrity of those\ntruths? \n\n\u003e “You fill the public sphere with things that aren’t true and you contradict\n\u003e yourself all the time.” Thinking of Donald Trump as a pathological liar is\n\u003e misguided in this context. Confusion and demobilization are regime policy.\n\nControl through confusion and unpredictability.

An example of digital rights management specifically designed for\ncorporate greed and consumer manipulation. \n\n\u003e The civics lesson in the new free software wars is that locked, proprietary\n\u003e code has the potential not only to destroy your privacy but also to reduce\n\u003e you to a condition of serfdom\n\nYou have no control, you have to use it, you cant repair it, take it apart or\nmodify it AND it makes money from your data.\n\n\u003e The implication of the corporate position is that as consumer goods\n\u003e increasingly become digitized and connected, consumers will not own, control,\n\u003e or have the ability to repair most of the things they buy and depend on.\n\nthe ability to repair is an interesting point. Certified repair shop = money\nmaking scheme\n\n\u003e but what it can’t do is generate reform [because reform would mean the\n\u003e kleptocrats would have to go], and it can’t generate wealth.”74\n\nTimothy Snyder on Russias political propoganda system.\n\n\u003e DRM effectively allowed the copyright holder to take control of a user’s\n\u003e computer to do the copyright holder’s bidding instead of the user’s and\n\u003e prohibited the user from even looking at what was being done.\n\nDigital Rights Management served more the interest of corporations than artists\n(also see [Chokepoint Capitalism](jqzb)). The artist receives a small mechanical\nroyalty for the sale, while the corporations get money, data or chance to\nlitigate (and make more money).\n\n## 9 Hacker Occupy: Bringing Occupy into Cyberspace and the Digital Era\n\n\u003e Neoliberalism encourages globalization and discourages government\n\u003e intervention\n\n\u003e The Arab Spring was in some ways the result of the hacker scene going global.\n\u003e With the penetration of the internet globally (and despite companies imposing\n\u003e commercially walled access in developing countries), came the growth of the\n\u003e hacker. The core organizers of the Arab Spring revolutions came from the\n\u003e hacker scene.\n\nThe hacker scene mobilized the Arab Spring\n\n\u003e The biggest problem with P2P solutions is trust. You have to trust your peers\n\u003e not to cheat or abuse you, especially when transferring things of value,\n\u003e because there are no central authorities to guarantee, authenticate, or\n\u003e necessarily enforce your transaction.\n\nSounds increasingly difficult. Is blockchain a possible solution to the\nchecksum trust issue? Or TOR, where a middle person cant target data streams as\nthe sender is anonymous.\n\n\u003e In January 2018, the Consortium started a legal clinic on platform\n\u003e cooperatives at Harvard Law School to find ways to make it easier to start\n\u003e these ventures legally.43 Currently, the law encourages the creation of\n\u003e capitalist corporations through all kinds of breaks and incentives without\n\u003e questioning whether these incentives would serve society better if they were\n\u003e given to cooperative enterprises.\n\nThe Platform Cooperativism Consortium. Supporting cooperative tech. ^e90768\n\n\u003e The Solid project is immensely important because if it or some other\n\u003e privately funded, ambitious (re)decentralization project takes off, it could\n\u003e be the closest thing to a new civilian internet that we get, assuming it\n\u003e beats the Chaos Computer Club’s “You Broke the Internet” effort and the\n\u003e European Union’s “[Next Generation Internet Initiative](../g/iryf)\"\n\nWatch those spaces\n\n\u003e Blockchain could furnish important solutions in developing countries, where\n\u003e people often lack credit and insurance, where property and identity records\n\u003e are often flawed, and where government corruption and war can destabilize\n\u003e regular ledger keeping.\n\nA positive use case for cryptocurrency\n\n\u003e farmers are hacking tractors to “free” them from unfair digital restrictions\n\u003e management (DRM); computer programmers are “hacking” copyright to “free”\n\u003e software generally; academics are hacking commercial enclosures of knowledge;\n\u003e cities are hacking internet service providers (ISPs) to take their local\n\u003e economies back into their own hands\n\nTechnology should enable people, not be used as a harness. If you find yourself\nin a harness, hack your way out.\n\n\u003e P2P could lead to the formation of peer-to-peer institutions that could rival\n\u003e current economic institutions.\n\nP2P can circumvent the control that corporations have on society. It enables\nthe creation of infrastructure that can rival existing services, the cost of\nwhich is shared by the people with freedom being the profit.\n\n\u003e DRM, DMCA, and EME injected the poison of black code into the system and made\n\u003e it criminal to clean up the pollutions it spread. It was a model that\n\u003e potentially encouraged a draconian lockdown of everything on the web—the gift\n\u003e to humankind that was supposed to be leading us all forward with its model of\n\u003e sharing and abundance.\n\nDRM is built into browsers, really?! 2023-05-06: yes, it's the browser that\ninterfaces with a services API and allows it to programatically decide what you\nmay or may not consume, based for example on your geo-location. \n\n## Hacking Democratic Decision Making Itself: A Canadian Algorithm for Global\nDemocracy\n\n\u003e It’s amazing to think how much our society is actually determined by the\n\u003e optimal size of group decision making. Beyond optimal size, we do delegated\n\u003e authority: the board will appoint a CEO, Parliament will appoint a cabinet, a\n\u003e group size that can actually manage it.\n\nOne reason why the Occupy Wall St lost its momentum. And an interesting\nphenomena.\n\n\u003e “All of society’s problems are solvable—war, poverty, global warming. It’s\n\u003e the group decisions that wear us down,” he says. “When you talk to people on\n\u003e the ground, they have solutions. They’re just paralyzed by the systems.\n\u003e People on the ground know what to do but can effect change only through group\n\u003e decision.”\n\nJohn Richardson. But everyone has their own idea too. I guess peoples ideas on\nthe ground are less inhibited by not only group size, but career and profit\nincentive as well.\n\n\u003e This is the formula he started with and he’s been been refining it ever\n\u003e since: Decision strength = [Average support] – [Variance in support]. Each\n\u003e person’s support for a decision will fall on a spectrum from total opposition\n\u003e to total support. The variance in that support across a group indicates the\n\u003e polarization of the group. Decisions that polarize groups are weaker than\n\u003e decisions that unify groups.\n\nEthelo algorithm. Richardson also has a startup by the same name. A tech\nstartup that explores new ways in group decision making.\n\n## No More Wrecking Balls\n\n\u003e Think, for example, about Linux. It is the dominant, most stable operating\n\u003e system in the world now. It achieved its stability by opening up its code and\n\u003e letting lots of minds peck away at it. Google is based on Linux. Linux is the\n\u003e go-to operating system. That’s what we would do at a certain point: open up\n\u003e our code and see where that takes us.”\n\nConnecting open source to social functionality. Open sourcing a process, making\nit transparent.\n\n\u003e The citizens who used their votes for Brexit and Donald Trump in the last\n\u003e half of 2016 felt they did not have much more than these wrecking balls to\n\u003e change the status quo.\n\nThe votes leading to Brexit and Trump were led by an experimentation in\ndestruction. To see what could come of it. Out of desperation to try something\nnew.\n\n## 10 Distributed Democracy: Experiments in Spain, Italy, and Canada\n\n\u003e much damning evidence was collected by 15MpaRato that the court was forced to\n\u003e take up the case, and in July 2012 it charged Rato and thirty-three board\n\u003e members of Bankia as well as Bankia’s parent company.\n\n15MpaRato crowd funded the take down of Bankia's board members.\n\n\u003e Barlow has been criticized for being a white, Western, male of a prefeminist\n\u003e era; for making assertions of universalism that are belied by self-centric\n\u003e assumptions about the world; for pushing another one of those utopian\n\u003e projects that have never ended well for Western societies; and for valorizing\n\u003e cyberspace as some virtual, global polity divorced from local, embodied\n\u003e polities.\n\n^46baca\n\nSummary of the criticism towards John Perry Barlow's \"Declaration of the\nIndependence of Cyberspace\"\n\n## The Value of Transgressive Acts\n\n\u003e Stoppard’s message is that if language and ideas are infectious like viruses,\n\u003e their transmission cannot be controlled, even by authoritarian states. The\n\u003e same could be said for code, and hackers have said it many times. “Our code\n\u003e is free for all to use, worldwide,” states Eric Hughes’s\n\nFork it. Clone it. Do it better. Over and over.\n\n## Hacker Crackdown 3.0\n\n\u003e But somewhere on the continuum of altruism and transgression is the kind of\n\u003e hacking that might lead the world toward more accountable government and\n\u003e informed citizenries, less corrupt and unfair economic systems, wiser public\n\u003e uses of digital tech, more self-determination for the ordinary user, fairer\n\u003e commercial contracts, better conditions for innovation and creativity, more\n\u003e decentralized and robust infrastructure systems, and an abolition of doomsday\n\u003e machines. In short, some hacking might move us toward a digital world in\n\u003e which there are more rather than fewer democratic, humanist outcomes.\n\n^8b0683\n\nWhat hacker culture can potentially bring when it's not itself corrupted.\n\n\u003e An activist, Andreas-Thomas Vogel, coordinated a DDoS protest against\n\u003e Lufthansa and was charged with “coercion.” The higher court voided Vogel’s\n\u003e conviction, holding that “the online protest did not constitute a show of\n\u003e force, but was intended to influence public opinion.” Vogel’s group,\n\u003e Libertad, applauded the ruling, stating, “Although it is virtual in nature,\n\u003e the Internet is still a real public space. Wherever dirty deals go down,\n\u003e protests also have to be possible.”62\n\nA good assertion. What this is compared to is the case of a truck driver in the\nUS who was sentenced to prison and $183k in damages for using DDoS software\nfrom Anonymous for 60 seconds.\n\n## Libre Planet, the Heart of Free Software\n\n\u003e It began with Snowden, to be sure. But even that is now comparatively small\n\u003e in scale to the global anxiety felt largely by young, relatively\n\u003e technologically adept people, who feel two things happening—societies\n\u003e slipping out of control around them to their own immediate disservice and a\n\u003e whole bunch of things going on that they themselves are a part of but that\n\u003e they know are not quite right.\n\nEben Moglen speaking\n\n\u003e When Richard called it slavery, it wasn’t a metaphor. It was simply an\n\u003e archaic political term for what it is like living in a world in which\n\u003e machines that you can’t understand and you can’t modify and you can’t do\n\u003e anything about control you and everybody else.\n\n^3d47c5\n\nMoglen. Nailing the truth\n\n\u003e Or what if we lived in cashless societies and “citizen rating” determined\n\u003e what you pay and when you get it or if you get it at all?\n\nCashless societies open themselves up to algorithmic modifications\n\n## Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation Awards\n\n\u003e It’s called slavery. But it doesn’t feel like that because it feels like\n\u003e inconvenience. It feels like friction in life, and if only you would be\n\u003e subconsciously adjusting to be a more compliant person, it would get more\n\u003e convenient.\n\nThe convenience loop\n\n\u003e The model of university as producer of knowledge-as-product-for-sale is a\n\u003e closed one. Knowledge is treated as property to be copyrighted, patented,\n\u003e classified, licensed, and litigated. Under this closed model, creative work\n\u003e cannot progress without negotiations about license fees\n\nAll things creative will suffer when closed sourced. Progress and development\nwill be headed by the entities with the most buying power, who will in turn\nseek to guard their riches. This is 10 fold with tech. It does not need to be\nclosed source. It stands to gain more from being open sourced. The degree to\nwhich it enables people only becomes consequential when the user is free, free\nas in free to use, not free to be used.\n\n\u003e When I ask Hassan what hacking means in this context, he says that hacking is\n\u003e between reform and revolution. Hacking is a disruptive reform that is\n\u003e revolutionary. It makes reformers happy because it does reform but does not\n\u003e break the system.\n\nSamer Hassan.","snippets":["Hacking as a philosophy and a practice is prefaced against the current state of\nthe internet, economic environment and political governance.

An example of digital rights management specifically designed for\ncorporate greed and consumer manipulation. \n\n\u003e The civics lesson in the new free software wars is that locked, proprietary\n\u003e code has the potential not only to destroy your privacy but also to reduce\n\u003e you to a condition of serfdom\n\nYou have no control, you have to use it, you cant repair it, take it apart or\nmodify it AND it makes money from your data.\n\n\u003e The implication of the corporate position is that as consumer goods\n\u003e increasingly become digitized and connected, consumers will not own, control,\n\u003e or have the ability to repair most of the things they buy and depend on.\n\nthe ability to repair is an interesting point.

The core organizers of the Arab Spring revolutions came from the\n\u003e hacker scene.\n\nThe hacker scene mobilized the Arab Spring\n\n\u003e The biggest problem with P2P solutions is trust. You have to trust your peers\n\u003e not to cheat or abuse you, especially when transferring things of value,\n\u003e because there are no central authorities to guarantee, authenticate, or\n\u003e necessarily enforce your transaction.\n\nSounds increasingly difficult. Is blockchain a possible solution to the\nchecksum trust issue? Or TOR, where a middle person cant target data streams as\nthe sender is anonymous.\n\n\u003e In January 2018, the Consortium started a legal clinic on platform\n\u003e cooperatives at Harvard Law School to find ways to make it easier to start\n\u003e these ventures legally.43 Currently, the law encourages the creation of\n\u003e capitalist corporations through all kinds of breaks and incentives without\n\u003e questioning whether these incentives would serve society better if they were\n\u003e given to cooperative enterprises.\n\nThe Platform Cooperativism Consortium. Supporting cooperative tech. ^e90768\n\n\u003e The Solid project is immensely important because if it or some other\n\u003e privately funded, ambitious (re)decentralization project takes off, it could\n\u003e be the closest thing to a new civilian internet that we get, assuming it\n\u003e beats the Chaos Computer Club’s “You Broke the Internet” effort and the\n\u003e European Union’s “[Next Generation Internet Initiative](../g/iryf)\"\n\nWatch those spaces\n\n\u003e Blockchain could furnish important solutions in developing countries, where\n\u003e people often lack credit and insurance, where property and identity records\n\u003e are often flawed, and where government corruption and war can destabilize\n\u003e regular ledger keeping.\n\nA positive use case for cryptocurrency\n\n\u003e farmers are hacking tractors to “free” them from unfair digital restrictions\n\u003e management (DRM); computer programmers are “hacking” copyright to “free”\n\u003e software generally; academics are hacking commercial enclosures of knowledge;\n\u003e cities are hacking internet service providers (ISPs) to take their local\n\u003e economies back into their own hands\n\nTechnology should enable people, not be used as a harness. If you find yourself\nin a harness, hack your way out.\n\n\u003e P2P could lead to the formation of peer-to-peer institutions that could rival\n\u003e current economic institutions.\n\nP2P can circumvent the control that corporations have on society. It enables\nthe creation of infrastructure that can rival existing services, the cost of\nwhich is shared by the people with freedom being the profit.\n\n\u003e DRM, DMCA, and EME injected the poison of black code into the system and made\n\u003e it criminal to clean up the pollutions it spread. It was a model that\n\u003e potentially encouraged a draconian lockdown of everything on the web—the gift\n\u003e to humankind that was supposed to be leading us all forward with its model of\n\u003e sharing and abundance.\n\nDRM is built into browsers, really?! 2023-05-06: yes, it's the browser that\ninterfaces with a services API and allows it to programatically decide what you\nmay or may not consume, based for example on your geo-location. \n\n## Hacking Democratic Decision Making Itself: A Canadian Algorithm for Global\nDemocracy\n\n\u003e It’s amazing to think how much our society is actually determined by the\n\u003e optimal size of group decision making. Beyond optimal size, we do delegated\n\u003e authority: the board will appoint a CEO, Parliament will appoint a cabinet, a\n\u003e group size that can actually manage it.\n\nOne reason why the Occupy Wall St lost its momentum. And an interesting\nphenomena.\n\n\u003e “All of society’s problems are solvable—war, poverty, global warming. It’s\n\u003e the group decisions that wear us down,” he says. “When you talk to people on\n\u003e the ground, they have solutions. They’re just paralyzed by the systems.\n\u003e People on the ground know what to do but can effect change only through group\n\u003e decision.”\n\nJohn Richardson. But everyone has their own idea too. I guess peoples ideas on\nthe ground are less inhibited by not only group size, but career and profit\nincentive as well.\n\n\u003e This is the formula he started with and he’s been been refining it ever\n\u003e since: Decision strength = [Average support] – [Variance in support]. Each\n\u003e person’s support for a decision will fall on a spectrum from total opposition\n\u003e to total support. The variance in that support across a group indicates the\n\u003e polarization of the group. Decisions that polarize groups are weaker than\n\u003e decisions that unify groups.\n\nEthelo algorithm. Richardson also has a startup by the same name. A tech\nstartup that explores new ways in group decision making.\n\n## No More Wrecking Balls\n\n\u003e Think, for example, about Linux. It is the dominant, most stable operating\n\u003e system in the world now. It achieved its stability by opening up its code and\n\u003e letting lots of minds peck away at it. Google is based on Linux. Linux is the\n\u003e go-to operating system. That’s what we would do at a certain point: open up\n\u003e our code and see where that takes us.”\n\nConnecting open source to social functionality. Open sourcing a process, making\nit transparent.\n\n\u003e The citizens who used their votes for Brexit and Donald Trump in the last\n\u003e half of 2016 felt they did not have much more than these wrecking balls to\n\u003e change the status quo.\n\nThe votes leading to Brexit and Trump were led by an experimentation in\ndestruction. To see what could come of it. Out of desperation to try something\nnew.\n\n## 10 Distributed Democracy: Experiments in Spain, Italy, and Canada\n\n\u003e much damning evidence was collected by 15MpaRato that the court was forced to\n\u003e take up the case, and in July 2012 it charged Rato and thirty-three board\n\u003e members of Bankia as well as Bankia’s parent company.\n\n15MpaRato crowd funded the take down of Bankia's board members.\n\n\u003e Barlow has been criticized for being a white, Western, male of a prefeminist\n\u003e era; for making assertions of universalism that are belied by self-centric\n\u003e assumptions about the world; for pushing another one of those utopian\n\u003e projects that have never ended well for Western societies; and for valorizing\n\u003e cyberspace as some virtual, global polity divorced from local, embodied\n\u003e polities.\n\n^46baca\n\nSummary of the criticism towards John Perry Barlow's \"Declaration of the\nIndependence of Cyberspace\"\n\n## The Value of Transgressive Acts\n\n\u003e Stoppard’s message is that if language and ideas are infectious like viruses,\n\u003e their transmission cannot be controlled, even by authoritarian states. The\n\u003e same could be said for code, and hackers have said it many times. “Our code\n\u003e is free for all to use, worldwide,” states Eric Hughes’s\n\nFork it. Clone it. Do it better. Over and over.\n\n## Hacker Crackdown 3.0\n\n\u003e But somewhere on the continuum of altruism and transgression is the kind of\n\u003e hacking that might lead the world toward more accountable government and\n\u003e informed citizenries, less corrupt and unfair economic systems, wiser public\n\u003e uses of digital tech, more self-determination for the ordinary user, fairer\n\u003e commercial contracts, better conditions for innovation and creativity, more\n\u003e decentralized and robust infrastructure systems, and an abolition of doomsday\n\u003e machines. In short, some hacking might move us toward a digital world in\n\u003e which there are more rather than fewer democratic, humanist outcomes.\n\n^8b0683\n\nWhat hacker culture can potentially bring when it's not itself corrupted.\n\n\u003e An activist, Andreas-Thomas Vogel, coordinated a DDoS protest against\n\u003e Lufthansa and was charged with “coercion.” The higher court voided Vogel’s\n\u003e conviction, holding that “the online protest did not constitute a show of\n\u003e force, but was intended to influence public opinion.” Vogel’s group,\n\u003e Libertad, applauded the ruling, stating, “Although it is virtual in nature,\n\u003e the Internet is still a real public space. Wherever dirty deals go down,\n\u003e protests also have to be possible.”62\n\nA good assertion. What this is compared to is the case of a truck driver in the\nUS who was sentenced to prison and $183k in damages for using DDoS software\nfrom Anonymous for 60 seconds.\n\n## Libre Planet, the Heart of Free Software\n\n\u003e It began with Snowden, to be sure. But even that is now comparatively small\n\u003e in scale to the global anxiety felt largely by young, relatively\n\u003e technologically adept people, who feel two things happening—societies\n\u003e slipping out of control around them to their own immediate disservice and a\n\u003e whole bunch of things going on that they themselves are a part of but that\n\u003e they know are not quite right.\n\nEben Moglen speaking\n\n\u003e When Richard called it slavery, it wasn’t a metaphor. It was simply an\n\u003e archaic political term for what it is like living in a world in which\n\u003e machines that you can’t understand and you can’t modify and you can’t do\n\u003e anything about control you and everybody else.\n\n^3d47c5\n\nMoglen. Nailing the truth\n\n\u003e Or what if we lived in cashless societies and “citizen rating” determined\n\u003e what you pay and when you get it or if you get it at all?\n\nCashless societies open themselves up to algorithmic modifications\n\n## Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation Awards\n\n\u003e It’s called slavery. But it doesn’t feel like that because it feels like\n\u003e inconvenience. It feels like friction in life, and if only you would be\n\u003e subconsciously adjusting to be a more compliant person, it would get more\n\u003e convenient.\n\nThe convenience loop\n\n\u003e The model of university as producer of knowledge-as-product-for-sale is a\n\u003e closed one. Knowledge is treated as property to be copyrighted, patented,\n\u003e classified, licensed, and litigated. Under this closed model, creative work\n\u003e cannot progress without negotiations about license fees\n\nAll things creative will suffer when closed sourced. Progress and development\nwill be headed by the entities with the most buying power, who will in turn\nseek to guard their riches. This is 10 fold with tech. It does not need to be\nclosed source. It stands to gain more from being open sourced. The degree to\nwhich it enables people only becomes consequential when the user is free, free\nas in free to use, not free to be used.\n\n\u003e When I ask Hassan what hacking means in this context, he says that hacking is\n\u003e between reform and revolution. Hacking is a disruptive reform that is\n\u003e revolutionary. It makes reformers happy because it does reform but does not\n\u003e break the system.\n\nSamer Hassan.\n","wordCount":3195,"tags":["book"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-04-29","people":["C.Doctorow","R.Giblin"],"tags":["book"]},"created":"2023-04-29T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:26:19.906347162Z","checksum":"eaacb59b0579ea6545e65d829b5f696261149342b98bbe0f3af0189da60358f7"},{"filename":"dueb.md","filenameStem":"dueb","path":"r/dueb.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/r/dueb.md","title":"Communicating with Slip Boxes","link":"[Communicating with Slip Boxes](r/dueb)","lead":"# Communicating with Slip Boxes","body":"# Communicating with Slip Boxes\n\n\nCommunication is a system, even with an object such as the Zettelkasten.\n\n- [Actor-Network Theory](../g/5c0r)\n\n\n~ 1.1\n\n...\n\nEffective writing involves being able to follow a schematic of thought.

It has however managed to develop elaborate procedures to resolve\n\u003e disputes and making rules. What are these procedures? How does governance\n\u003e look in true CBPP (ie without hierarchy)?  \n\n\u003e p. 7 Two alternate movements emerging at the end of 2020,\n\u003e [technoliberalism](../g/smp3) and \"nudge-progressivism\".  \n\u003e \n\u003e \"nudge-progressivism\" is based on the idea that governments can collect\n\u003e enough data to sufficiently develop models that overcome the current\n\u003e limitations of regulation by uncovering behavioural recommendations that the\n\u003e public can follow to better themselves and the public good. This model allows\n\u003e individuals to maintain their agency, but also offers a solution for others\n\u003e who have less self agency. \n\n\u003e p. 8 Call to integrate a different funding model than the current\n\u003e advertisement based model; Public funding, philanthropy, non-profit donation\n\u003e based.\n\n\u003e p. 9 We need to look at CBPP in its successes and failures and integrate them\n\u003e into systems that also seek to harness the more traditional models of\n\u003e organisation - namely the state. A traditional model of organisation here is\n\u003e the participatory and social, and not that which is dependant or subservient\n\u003e to the discipline of markets.\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- Benkler, Yochai. “From Utopia to Practice and Back,” n.d.","snippets":["## Summary"],"rawContent":"---\ntitle: \"From Utopia to Practice and Back\"\ndate: 2023-04-01\ntag: [text, essay]\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYochai Benkler establishes the idea of commons-based peer production and\nthat we need to understand how this process can be implemented more widely as a\nstable and effective alternative to neoliberalism.

(Neoliberalism being a structure\n\u003e of free market capitalism with little or no governmental regulation or\n\u003e oversight)\n\n\u003e p. 2 Yochai Benkler first wrote about Wikipedia in 2002 arguing that\n\u003e Wikipedia was a prime example of an emerging form of production -\n\u003e [commons-based production](../2o9k). \n\n\u003e p. 3 The first form of \"freedom\" that commons-based production offered was\n\u003e freedom from the markets.\n\n\u003e p. 4 CBPP enabled the circumvention of restrictions imposed by corporate\n\u003e software, ISPs and governments. \n\n\u003e p. 6 IoT devices run Linux, and while Linux is an open source\n\u003e initiative based around CBPP, these devices can still surveil the end user,\n\u003e the data of which is integrated into the neoliberal profit making schemes\n\u003e that CBPP aims to negate. \n\n\u003e p. 6 Despite Wikipedia not falling into governance structures of state of\n\u003e corporate form, it is also (yet) to develop its own effective form of\n\u003e governance. It has however managed to develop elaborate procedures to resolve\n\u003e disputes and making rules. What are these procedures? How does governance\n\u003e look in true CBPP (ie without hierarchy)?  \n\n\u003e p. 7 Two alternate movements emerging at the end of 2020,\n\u003e [technoliberalism](../g/smp3) and \"nudge-progressivism\".  \n\u003e \n\u003e \"nudge-progressivism\" is based on the idea that governments can collect\n\u003e enough data to sufficiently develop models that overcome the current\n\u003e limitations of regulation by uncovering behavioural recommendations that the\n\u003e public can follow to better themselves and the public good. This model allows\n\u003e individuals to maintain their agency, but also offers a solution for others\n\u003e who have less self agency. \n\n\u003e p. 8 Call to integrate a different funding model than the current\n\u003e advertisement based model; Public funding, philanthropy, non-profit donation\n\u003e based.\n\n\u003e p. 9 We need to look at CBPP in its successes and failures and integrate them\n\u003e into systems that also seek to harness the more traditional models of\n\u003e organisation - namely the state. A traditional model of organisation here is\n\u003e the participatory and social, and not that which is dependant or subservient\n\u003e to the discipline of markets.\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- Benkler, Yochai. “From Utopia to Practice and Back,” n.d.\n\n","wordCount":654,"tags":["text","essay"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-04-01","tag":["text","essay"],"title":"From Utopia to Practice and Back"},"created":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:22:38.247927103Z","checksum":"9a40314a79949d738cf9a920c28fb15c149808045f964e1e750af7443450cdcf"},{"filename":"o5we.md","filenameStem":"o5we","path":"g/o5we.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/g/o5we.md","title":"GATO - DeepMind Generalist AI","link":"[GATO - DeepMind Generalist AI](g/o5we)","lead":"Generalist AI that can perform \u003e400 different tasks.

But literature often does not address this difference.\n\n\u003e p. 150 It is not enough for a commodity to have a use case, it must also have\n\u003e an exchange value. Something that makes it stand in relation to other\n\u003e commodities. \n\n---\n\n\u003e [Capitalism revolves around the abstraction of time, and is mediated by\n\u003e money](../hood). Commodity producers compete over reducing this time, which\n\u003e they need to balance with cost of production. \n^130172\n\n\u003e p.151 Productive consumption is the process with which capital (machinery,\n\u003e property, labor) is worn down and cannot be retrieved. But this model can be\n\u003e organised so that value can be transferred from a preexistent commodity to a\n\u003e newly produced one. I think this is relating to the shift from selling\n\u003e individual music files (iTunes) to streaming. There was a transferral of the\n\u003e commodity, but what happened to it in that process? Is this somehow related to\n\u003e how the Swedish industry saw television as more of a content than a\n\u003e technology? ([see summary](zm2t))\n\n\u003e p. 153 The anthropologist Appadurai writes that a commodity environment\n\u003e requires the need to sacrifice one object in order to access another. In a\n\u003e modern society this usually means money, but other forms of exchange are also\n\u003e found, such as open source and [commons-based production](../2o9k). \n\n\u003e p. 154 The price of a subscription on Spotify defines the non-existence of a\n\u003e \"commodity situation\" in both the views of cultural anthropologists\n\u003e (Appadurai) and Marxian economists. There is no acquisition of an object\n\u003e (through sacrifice of another, money). What is instead being sold is the\n\u003e right to listen uninterrupted by adds, a license to non-interruption.\n\n## Producing the Branded Musical Experience\n\n\u003e p. 156 Daniel Ek (Spotify CEO) states, \"We're not in the music space - we're\n\u003e in the moment space\". Their goal is to sell a service to accompany every\n\u003e moment of someone's day or night. An individual soundtrack service. \n\u003e \n\u003e \u003eThey want to sell “music as an affective experience rather than as individual\n\u003e \u003esongs” ... Ultimately, we suggest that digital music services no longer sell\n\u003e \u003ediscrete musical objects, nor do they focus exclusively on content offerings.\n\u003e \u003eInstead, services sell branded musical experiences, inviting consumers to see\n\u003e \u003ethemselves and their attitudes, habits and sentiments about music reflected\n\u003e \u003eby the service they choose to adopt.

Something that makes it stand in relation to other\n\u003e commodities. \n\n---\n\n\u003e [Capitalism revolves around the abstraction of time, and is mediated by\n\u003e money](../hood). Commodity producers compete over reducing this time, which\n\u003e they need to balance with cost of production. \n^130172\n\n\u003e p.151 Productive consumption is the process with which capital (machinery,\n\u003e property, labor) is worn down and cannot be retrieved. But this model can be\n\u003e organised so that value can be transferred from a preexistent commodity to a\n\u003e newly produced one. I think this is relating to the shift from selling\n\u003e individual music files (iTunes) to streaming. There was a transferral of the\n\u003e commodity, but what happened to it in that process? Is this somehow related to\n\u003e how the Swedish industry saw television as more of a content than a\n\u003e technology? ([see summary](zm2t))\n\n\u003e p. 153 The anthropologist Appadurai writes that a commodity environment\n\u003e requires the need to sacrifice one object in order to access another. In a\n\u003e modern society this usually means money, but other forms of exchange are also\n\u003e found, such as open source and [commons-based production](../2o9k). \n\n\u003e p. 154 The price of a subscription on Spotify defines the non-existence of a\n\u003e \"commodity situation\" in both the views of cultural anthropologists\n\u003e (Appadurai) and Marxian economists. There is no acquisition of an object\n\u003e (through sacrifice of another, money). What is instead being sold is the\n\u003e right to listen uninterrupted by adds, a license to non-interruption.\n\n## Producing the Branded Musical Experience\n\n\u003e p. 156 Daniel Ek (Spotify CEO) states, \"We're not in the music space - we're\n\u003e in the moment space\". Their goal is to sell a service to accompany every\n\u003e moment of someone's day or night. An individual soundtrack service. \n\u003e \n\u003e \u003eThey want to sell “music as an affective experience rather than as individual\n\u003e \u003esongs” ... Ultimately, we suggest that digital music services no longer sell\n\u003e \u003ediscrete musical objects, nor do they focus exclusively on content offerings.\n\u003e \u003eInstead, services sell branded musical experiences, inviting consumers to see\n\u003e \u003ethemselves and their attitudes, habits and sentiments about music reflected\n\u003e \u003eby the service they choose to adopt. (Morris \u0026 Powers 2015).\n^ec6800\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\u003e p. 158\n\u003e Spotify can be classified as a commodity producer, but has more in common with traditional broadcasters. \n\n\n\u003e The decommodification of individual recordings (at the consumer’s side), now coincides with the recommodification of music as an experience.\n\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- Fleischer, Rasmus. “If the Song Has No Price, Is It Still a Commodity? :\n  Rethinking the Commodification of Digital Music.” Culture Unbound 9, no. 2\n  (October 31, 2017): 146–62. https://doi.org/10.3384/cu.2000.1525.1792146.\n\n","wordCount":1196,"tags":["text","essay"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-04-01","tag":["text","essay"],"title":"If the Song has No Price, is it Still a Commodity? : Rethinking the Commodification of Digital Music"},"created":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:22:38.229425799Z","checksum":"44700f10d566c7bdb221dd8f9e19d2d2f4d3ac7922a6470316c8d80d5924334a"},{"filename":"3iwt.md","filenameStem":"3iwt","path":"3iwt.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/3iwt.md","title":"Implementing Luhmens Zettelkasten","link":"[Implementing Luhmens Zettelkasten](3iwt)","lead":"From, [How to Take Smart Notes](r/kbxy) loc: 398","body":"From, [How to Take Smart Notes](r/kbxy) loc: 398\n\n1.

Despite this, social media platforms comply\n\u003e with a small percentage of requests from the government, showing the power\n\u003e these companies do in fact have with regards to controlling content.

They\ncan counter competitive advantage, remove or block accounts, adhere or decline\nthe requests of national governments and control how users interact with their\nproduct through different hardware. e.g intentionally making their browser\nversion of the app terrible to use - thereby navigating around the privacy\nconstraints of some browsers. Instagram does not let you upload photos via the\ncomputer and google maps performs terribly on mobile browser.\n\n\u003e p. 1 Addresses governance by social media rather than governance of social\n\u003e media. Specifically, the article examines the extent to which these platforms\n\u003e promote or constrain rights in three thematic areas: anonymity and privacy;\n\u003e freedom of speech; and restrictiveness of the platform's interoperability with\n\u003e other services and technologies.\n\n\u003e p. 1 The technical infrastructure of the internet is of significant public\n\u003e interest implications. The design and administration of this infrastructure is\n\u003e commonly referred to as \"internet governance\"\n\n\u003e p. 2 Looking at the conflicting themes of simultaneous governmental regulation\n\u003e and usage of social media, that platforms serve as a type of \"privatised\n\u003e governance\" for the public (potentially leading to dissent).\n\n\u003e p. 2 Governments embed political values in the design and operation of\n\u003e internet infrastructures and technologies by way of co-opting the various\n\u003e internet governance organisations. This is increasingly done for purposes\n\u003e irrelevant to the primary function of internet governance - to keep the\n\u003e internet functioning as a sound and unopinionated technical system.\n\n\u003e p. 3 Private companies are taking an increasingly central role in regulating\n\u003e civil liberties through the \"ongoing privatisation of internet\n\u003e governance\". This ties in with [The helping hand: In Search of a Swedish\n\u003e Institutional Regime for Infrastructural Systems](s2ly), whereby Kaijser shows\n\u003e how it has been seen that private intermediaries are given the responsibility\n\u003e of managing sections of infrastructure and that this can lead to issues down\n\u003e the line.\n\n\u003e p. 4 Interesting cases for why a real name identification policy online can be\n\u003e dangerous or impinge on the user's basic rights.\n\n\u003e p. 5 The \"privatisation of privacy governance\": whether anonymity is\n\u003e permissible, what information is collected about users, and how this\n\u003e information is shared with third parties.\n\n\u003e p. 6 The Communication Decency Act provides immunity for social media\n\u003e platforms against content posted by their users.\n\n\u003e p. 7 The government is constantly requesting social media platforms to remove\n\u003e or block content and accounts. Despite this, social media platforms comply\n\u003e with a small percentage of requests from the government, showing the power\n\u003e these companies do in fact have with regards to controlling content. Social\n\u003e media companies release these figures in their Transparency Reports\n\n\u003e p. 8 Platforms often behave like gatekeepers and constrain their users - eg\n\u003e maintaining competitive advantage by blocking rival products.\n\u003e\n\u003e We saw this recently with Musk blocking links to Mastodon.\n\u003e\n\u003e The disclosure of NSA's mass surveillance incited a greater interest for\n\u003e privacy, encryption and routing internet traffic around US servers.\n\u003e\n\u003e Social media platforms have eroded the interoperability of the internet by\n\u003e establishing such great market share, but developing propriatorey API's that\n\u003e relate only to their service.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n- DeNardis, L., and A.M.

It\n\u003e is also a book about what we know, how we know, and what we cannot know. Over\n\u003e the last century, technological acceleration has transformed our planet, our\n\u003e societies, and ourselves, but it has failed to transform our understanding of\n\u003e these things. The reasons for this are complex, and the answers are complex\n\u003e too, not least because we ourselves are utterly enmeshed in technological\n\u003e systems, which shape in turn how we act and how we think. We cannot stand\n\u003e outside them; we cannot think without them. Our technologies are complicit in\n\u003e the greatest challenges we face today: an out-of-control economic system that\n\u003e immiserates many and continues to widen the gap between rich and poor; the\n\u003e collapse of political and societal consensus across the globe resulting in\n\u003e increasing nationalisms, social divisions, ethnic conflicts and shadow wars;\n\u003e and a warming climate, which existentially threatens us all. Across the\n\u003e sciences and society, in politics and education, in warfare and commerce, new\n\u003e technologies do not merely augment our abilities, but actively shape and\n\u003e direct them, for better and for worse. It is increasingly necessary to be able\n\u003e to think new technologies in different ways, and to be critical of them, in\n\u003e order to meaningfully participate in that shaping and directing. If we do not\n\u003e understand how complex technologies function, how systems of technologies\n\u003e interconnect, and how systems of systems interact, then we are powerless\n\u003e within them, and their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and\n\u003e inhuman corporations. Precisely because these technologies interact with one\n\u003e another in unexpected and often-strange ways, and because we are completely\n\u003e entangled with them, this understanding cannot be limited to the\n\u003e practicalities of how things work: it must be extended to how things came to\n\u003e be, and how they continue to function in the world in ways that are often\n\u003e invisible and interwoven.

It\n\u003e is also a book about what we know, how we know, and what we cannot know. Over\n\u003e the last century, technological acceleration has transformed our planet, our\n\u003e societies, and ourselves, but it has failed to transform our understanding of\n\u003e these things. The reasons for this are complex, and the answers are complex\n\u003e too, not least because we ourselves are utterly enmeshed in technological\n\u003e systems, which shape in turn how we act and how we think. We cannot stand\n\u003e outside them; we cannot think without them. Our technologies are complicit in\n\u003e the greatest challenges we face today: an out-of-control economic system that\n\u003e immiserates many and continues to widen the gap between rich and poor; the\n\u003e collapse of political and societal consensus across the globe resulting in\n\u003e increasing nationalisms, social divisions, ethnic conflicts and shadow wars;\n\u003e and a warming climate, which existentially threatens us all. Across the\n\u003e sciences and society, in politics and education, in warfare and commerce, new\n\u003e technologies do not merely augment our abilities, but actively shape and\n\u003e direct them, for better and for worse. It is increasingly necessary to be able\n\u003e to think new technologies in different ways, and to be critical of them, in\n\u003e order to meaningfully participate in that shaping and directing. If we do not\n\u003e understand how complex technologies function, how systems of technologies\n\u003e interconnect, and how systems of systems interact, then we are powerless\n\u003e within them, and their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and\n\u003e inhuman corporations. Precisely because these technologies interact with one\n\u003e another in unexpected and often-strange ways, and because we are completely\n\u003e entangled with them, this understanding cannot be limited to the\n\u003e practicalities of how things work: it must be extended to how things came to\n\u003e be, and how they continue to function in the world in ways that are often\n\u003e invisible and interwoven.

Or that you don't care about freedom of the\n\u003e press because you don't like to read. - p. 208\n\n\u003e Saying that you don't need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is\n\u003e to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything --\n\u003e including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history\n\u003e and health records. - p. 208\n\nPeople in general do not fully understand the implications of totally\nrelinquishing their privacy. Stating that privacy is not needed or wanted is a\nselfish statement and does not take into consideration the way that governments,\nagencies and companies may manipulate society and people. This is particularly\nthe case for cultural or religious minorities. \n\n90% of internet traffic goes through servers owned or operated either directly\nor indirectly by the US (stated early in the book). The NSA has a weapon named\nTURBULANCE, which watches traffic and flags whether the NSA would find it\nsuspicious or not. If it is deemed suspicious, (e.g. containing keywords such as\n\"anonymous internet proxy\" or \"protest\") the HTTPS request gets diverted to an\nNSA server which algorithmically defines malware to inject into the web traffic\nthat arrives back at your computer along with the original web page that you\nrequested. At that point the NSA has fullcontrol and visibility into your\ncomputer. - p. 225 \n\n\u003e It falls to independent open-source hardware and software\n\u003e developers to close that gap by providing the vital civil liberties\n\u003e protections that the law may be unable, or unwilling, to guarantee - p. 239\n\nHere Snowden is talking about how the law lags behind technology so much, that\ngovernments and agencies can use that time to develop technologies that exploit\nthat lag. An example was given about the move from HTTP to HTTPS. This\ntechnological innovation made it significantly harder for technological\nsurveillance to occur. \n\n","wordCount":495,"tags":["text","book"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-08-01","people":["E.Snowden"],"tags":["text","book"]},"created":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-08-12T17:33:53.886395321Z","checksum":"8bc3c59ee1fafcde75ddf34191d72b059ddbe664a6ecca68d71b8b09f4390d68"},{"filename":"u1om.md","filenameStem":"u1om","path":"r/u1om.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/r/u1om.md","title":"Some Thoughts on the Question \"How Do New Things Happen?\"","link":"[Some Thoughts on the Question \"How Do New Things Happen?\"](r/u1om)","lead":"# Some Thoughts on the Question \"How Do New Things Happen?\"","body":"# Some Thoughts on the Question \"How Do New Things Happen?\"\n\nA speech given at SHOT.

In contrast to attempting to clear the mind of\n\u003e thoughts, the second category of meditation, Open Monitoring, also known as\n\u003e mindfulness, is about learning to observe thoughts dispassionately, without\n\u003e judgement, as they come and go.

This means that the electrical activity in the brain\n\u003e reaches a frequency per second of about 20 to 50 hertz (Hz), or cycles per\n\u003e second. You see a similar result when a student concentrates on a mathematical\n\u003e problem – which makes sense, because gamma waves are found when one is engaged\n\u003e in a challenging task. In contrast to attempting to clear the mind of\n\u003e thoughts, the second category of meditation, Open Monitoring, also known as\n\u003e mindfulness, is about learning to observe thoughts dispassionately, without\n\u003e judgement, as they come and go. This is because thoughts themselves are not\n\u003e seen as the potential disrupter of calm, but rather it is the content or\n\u003e meaning of thoughts that can disrupt.  ^ref-32624\n\n---\n\n##### loc: 164 (01-10-2019)\n\n\u003e Back to the ocean analogy.  ^ref-18525\n\n---\n\n##### loc: 178 (01-10-2019)\n\n\u003e Transcendental Meditation is in this category.

Reduce Verb Phrases to Simple Verbs\n    Identify the verb buried in a verb phrase and omit the rest of the phrase.\n\n    Don't: “The results are suggestive of the fact that tampering has occurred.”\n    Do: “The results suggest that tampering has occurred.”\n\n7.  Replace Complex Words with Simple Ones\n    Choose simpler synonyms for multisyllabic words. I am not sure I agree with this - it is up to your personal style.\n\n    Don't: “The department will disseminate the forms soon.”\n    Do: “The department will pass out the forms soon.”\n\n8.  Avoid Expletives\n    Don’t start sentences with “There is,” “There are,” or “It is.”\n\n    Don't: “There are many factors in the product’s failure.”\n    Do: “Many factors contributed to the product’s failure.”\n\n9.  Eliminate Prepositional Phrases Replace “(noun1) of the (noun2)” phrasing with “(noun2)’s (noun1)” phrasing.\n\n    Don't: “The decision of the committee is final.”\n    Do: “The committee’s decision is final.”\n\n10. Reduce Wordy Phrases to Single Words\n    Replace phrases that signal a transition with simple conjunctions, verbs, or other linking words.\n\n## More Dos and Donts\n\nDon't: Due to the fact that the project is behind schedule, today’s meeting has been postponed.\n**Do:** Because the project is behind schedule, today’s meeting has been postponed.\n\nDon't: “The meeting was seen as a ploy to delay the project.”\n**Do:** “We saw the meeting as a ploy to delay the project.”\nBut don’t do this: “We then sort the vertices by height…”. Unless you are manually doing the sorting yourself, and not the algorithm.\n\nDon't: \"The decision of the committee was...\"\n**Do:** \"The committee's decision was \"\n\nAvoid:\n\n- emotional language (we feel very strongly...)\n- flowery language\n- superlatives (coldest, tallest, softest, etc)\n- \"it was very impressive\"\n\n## Grammar and Tense\n\n### Present Tense\n\nIn a paper everything you do is in present tense, also things that come later in the paper.\nDon't: \"In Section 3 we are going to show…\"\nDo: “In Section 3 we are showing…\"\n\n### Which vs. That\n\nOne of my personal pet peeves is the incorrect use of _which_ vs. _that_.\n_That_\n\n- Introduces what is called an essential clause. Essential clauses add information that is vital to the point of the sentence and can not be left out.\n- Example: I do not trust products that claim \"all natural ingredients\" because this phrase can mean almost anything.\n  - We would not know the type of products being discussed without the _that_ clause.\n\n_Which_\n\n- Introduces a nonessential clause, which adds supplementary information.\n- Example: The product claiming \"all natural ingredients,\" which appeared in the Sunday newspaper, is on sale.\n  - The product is already identified. Therefore, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper is a nonessential clause containing additional, but not essential, information.\n\nEssential clauses (that) do not have comma introducing or surrounding them, whereas nonessential clauses (which) are introduced or surrounded by commata!\n\n","wordCount":783,"tags":["text"],"metadata":{"date":"2022-07-10 21:32","tags":["text"]},"created":"2022-07-10T21:32:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:22:38.207892701Z","checksum":"8560696d8f93a71ef287715d9fd3d235a19d251e75ed2c448fde5d0b86c9beb4"},{"filename":"gh6v.md","filenameStem":"gh6v","path":"g/gh6v.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/g/gh6v.md","title":"Technological Determinism","link":"[Technological Determinism](g/gh6v)","lead":"\u003e Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or\n\u003e technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change.

I have found that the existence of unrealized, unconscious\n\u003e fantasies increases the frequency and intensity of dreams, and that when\n\u003e these fantasies are made conscious the dreams change their character and\n\u003e become weaker and less frequent.  ^ref-1049\n","wordCount":600,"tags":["text","book"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-04-01","people":["C.Jung"],"tags":["text","book"]},"created":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:26:19.899108616Z","checksum":"0b12f54c6ba1b1c58f6863e7372444bfa29857141448ae78e74c410277d38b55"},{"filename":"k1cu.md","filenameStem":"k1cu","path":"k1cu.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/k1cu.md","title":"The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie","link":"[The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](k1cu)","lead":"\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6avJHaC3C2U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","body":"\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6avJHaC3C2U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe game of life.

Or\ndoes it simply fill in the inner four unknwn artworks with four 'developments'\nof art through time?\n\n\u003e He asked himself: How can I use the same methods and get different results?\n\nForking off from the norm and using the same tools to do it constitute a\ncreative process for me. \n\n\u003e This blank canvas is then propagated back and forth through the system so that\n\u003e it captures as much as possible of the style of the painting and the content\n\u003e of the photograph, mixing them both together until it finally reproduces the\n\u003e image in the photograph in the style of the painting.\n\nA strange part of the process for style transfer. \n1. Input style image\n2. Input content image\n3. Run a static / white noise image through\n\nThe tatic image is then like the canvas. A slate on which to combine two other\nsources. The slate does not inform then the combination, hencethestyle transfer.\nWhat happens if you replace the white static wuth something else?\n\n\u003e Having equipped his machine with a huge number of stylized letters and the\n\u003e code for DeepDream, he fed in the Mona Lisa.

But it\nmight not work the same in this case.\n\n\u003e This, says Gatys, is like having a vague image of what a forest was like last\n\u003e time you saw one, then using this information to imagine a brand-new forest.\n\u003e He is optimistic that style transfer will offer new insights into the way\n\u003e people see and hopes that it is a first step toward understanding perception.\n\nTalking of style transfer. Interesting application, to help understand how\nvisual perception works. It could also help understand why dreams are often so\nsurreal. oceans of fire, etc.\n\n\u003e The degrees of separation vary with the images chosen. Sometimes there are\n\u003e five, sometimes eight.\n\nThe model just compares every image in its current visual makeup, and does not\ntake into account stylistic or historical data.\n\n\u003e Henry firmly believes that machines cannot be creative by themselves. “The\n\u003e more complex the tool, the more creative we can be,” he says.\n\nNonesense. Creativity has always and will always be enabled in great part by\nlimitations and accessibility to circumven these limitations.

A good sumation\n\n\u003e The current head of AMI is Kenric McDowell, who focuses on “spinning\n\u003e narratives around machine intelligence and how we can relate to it.\n\nLook into this guy. Similar parallels it would seem\n\n## 9. What Came after DeepDream?\n\n\nUsing ML to find connections between artworks. No artwork is further than six\nsteps of rlation to any other. But was the six steps a constant programmed into\nthe model? Did it really confirm the phenomena of six derees of separation? Or\ndoes it simply fill in the inner four unknwn artworks with four 'developments'\nof art through time?\n\n\u003e He asked himself: How can I use the same methods and get different results?\n\nForking off from the norm and using the same tools to do it constitute a\ncreative process for me. \n\n\u003e This blank canvas is then propagated back and forth through the system so that\n\u003e it captures as much as possible of the style of the painting and the content\n\u003e of the photograph, mixing them both together until it finally reproduces the\n\u003e image in the photograph in the style of the painting.\n\nA strange part of the process for style transfer. \n1. Input style image\n2. Input content image\n3. Run a static / white noise image through\n\nThe tatic image is then like the canvas. A slate on which to combine two other\nsources. The slate does not inform then the combination, hencethestyle transfer.\nWhat happens if you replace the white static wuth something else?\n\n\u003e Having equipped his machine with a huge number of stylized letters and the\n\u003e code for DeepDream, he fed in the Mona Lisa. Out came a Mona Lisa transformed\n\u003e into an alphabetized linocut\n\nThe birth of style transfer?\n\n\u003e As for Gatys’s views on creativity, he feels that we will need to understand\n\u003e human creativity better before we can evaluate our progress toward machine\n\u003e creativity.\n\nWe often use computers to uncover answers to questions of ourselves. But it\nmight not work the same in this case.\n\n\u003e This, says Gatys, is like having a vague image of what a forest was like last\n\u003e time you saw one, then using this information to imagine a brand-new forest.\n\u003e He is optimistic that style transfer will offer new insights into the way\n\u003e people see and hopes that it is a first step toward understanding perception.\n\nTalking of style transfer. Interesting application, to help understand how\nvisual perception works. It could also help understand why dreams are often so\nsurreal. oceans of fire, etc.\n\n\u003e The degrees of separation vary with the images chosen. Sometimes there are\n\u003e five, sometimes eight.\n\nThe model just compares every image in its current visual makeup, and does not\ntake into account stylistic or historical data.\n\n\u003e Henry firmly believes that machines cannot be creative by themselves. “The\n\u003e more complex the tool, the more creative we can be,” he says.\n\nNonesense. Creativity has always and will always be enabled in great part by\nlimitations and accessibility to circumven these limitations. Creativity does\nnot get enabled by higher complexity of tools.\n","wordCount":2001,"tags":["text","book"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-03-19","people":["A.Miller"],"tags":["text","book"]},"created":"2023-03-19T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:26:19.907306163Z","checksum":"cd51acb7539a34e1ac05f367c1c3d3a01219515e39148576cb22cce10b2fdd64"},{"filename":"9ggq.md","filenameStem":"9ggq","path":"9ggq.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/9ggq.md","title":"The Century of the Self","link":"[The Century of the Self](9ggq)","lead":"This documentary series definitely requires a place in my Obsidian vault. \nBut not right now...","body":"This documentary series definitely requires a place in my Obsidian vault. \nBut not right now...\n\n\n###### SEE ALSO\n---","snippets":["This documentary series definitely requires a place in my Obsidian vault. \nBut not right now..."],"rawContent":"---\ndate: 2023-03-12\naliases:\ntags:\n- seed\n---\n↑ EXIT NOTE\n← MOTHER NOTE\n\n# The Century of the Self\n\nThis documentary series definitely requires a place in my Obsidian vault. \nBut not right now...\n\n\n###### SEE ALSO\n---\n ","wordCount":39,"tags":["seed"],"metadata":{"aliases":null,"date":"2023-03-12","tags":["seed"]},"created":"2023-03-12T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:21:24.262136594Z","checksum":"251efb6e99c4cb801b9e1d9c15b2dcd404b0fe649a4a23d6896f5d788e25d823"},{"filename":"5tx8.md","filenameStem":"5tx8","path":"r/5tx8.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/r/5tx8.md","title":"The Changelog - AI Assisted Programming and Tab Nine","link":"[The Changelog - AI Assisted Programming and Tab Nine](r/5tx8)","lead":"[Tab nine](https://www.tabnine.com/) - AI assisted code completion.

From this an emergent structure arises (or doesn't) and is studied.\n\nBy _limiting_ the traits, less complexity of interact in causality of emergent\nstructure is introduced.\n\nThis approach is exemplified in ant colonies, where a few rules of interaction\nbetween blind ants can give rise to a complex mega-structure.\n\n† this is again a distilling of how\n[a well functioning Zettelkasten System increases order](../jzcf).\n\n~ p.597\n\n...\n\nIt's the relationships _between_ entities, that defines what those entities are.\n\n† In Zettelkasten, the relationships between entities are signified with links:\n[Zettelkasten promotes ideation due to inter-note linking](../mv04). Similarly,\nthis is the same when asking the question, \"who is so-and-so to you?\".

E.g, a structure note\ngives a comprehensive view of the Zettelkasten.\n\n~ p.568\n\n...\n\nThe purist 2-LS approach is that there exists some sort of central actor or\nforce that determines collective behaviour.

From this point, 'the whole' has become a\n_simpler_ set of attributes. It is characterised by a constantly changing inner\ncomposition, but it is not a _created higher structure_ by the parts.\n\nIt is now _smaller_ than the sum of its parts, as to be part of the whole is no\nlonger a matter of 'entering into' a higher structure, but for any given entity\nto _lend part of itself_ to other entities without either of them losing their\nmultiple identities. 'The whole' is therefore an entity that is borrowing parts\nfrom all other entities at any given moment, but from the viewpoint you are\ncurrently looking from. It shares the same definition and construct of any other\nentity; it _is_ its own entity.\n\nThis concept is synthesized in\n[Zettelkasten promotes ideation due to inter-note linking](../mv04) and\naddressed with extra detail in\n[The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle, p.32](9xae)\n\n~ p.607\n\n...\n\nEach shared association to a monad creates individuality due to the previous set\nof associations always being different; n+1 so to say.

This frees us from having to make large jumps between the micro and\nmacro levels in order to derive understanding.\n\n~ p.595\n\n...\n\nCompares the 2-LS approach (micro behaviour leading to macro structure) to that\nof [holistic analysis](../g/zncr). This is counter to 1-LS which describes there\nbeing no concept of a 'whole' and its 'components'. The 'whole' _is_ another\n'component'.\n\n~ p.596\n\n...\n\nThe process of 2-LS study is to imagine the individual entities _limited_ to as\nfew traits as possible; then to derive rules of _interactions_ between those\nentities. From this an emergent structure arises (or doesn't) and is studied.\n\nBy _limiting_ the traits, less complexity of interact in causality of emergent\nstructure is introduced.\n\nThis approach is exemplified in ant colonies, where a few rules of interaction\nbetween blind ants can give rise to a complex mega-structure.\n\n† this is again a distilling of how\n[a well functioning Zettelkasten System increases order](../jzcf).\n\n~ p.597\n\n...\n\nIt's the relationships _between_ entities, that defines what those entities are.\n\n† In Zettelkasten, the relationships between entities are signified with links:\n[Zettelkasten promotes ideation due to inter-note linking](../mv04). Similarly,\nthis is the same when asking the question, \"who is so-and-so to you?\". They may\nbe different to someone else.\n\nA monad (entity) is not part of a whole, but a _different point of view_ on all\nother entities, and importantly _not_ as a whole.\n\nThe more that's added to a monad (the more text and links are added to a note)\nthe more robust a view is achievable from that monad. E.g, a structure note\ngives a comprehensive view of the Zettelkasten.\n\n~ p.568\n\n...\n\nThe purist 2-LS approach is that there exists some sort of central actor or\nforce that determines collective behaviour. But this leads then to the question:\n_How come some agents are able to produce an order without any central actor?_\n\n† This would seem to lead to the question of God's existence.\n\n~ p.601\n\n...\n\nAll entities within any given structure are points of view (see p.568). That\nincludes entities that are created through collective action.\n\n† Our cells build our body, which includes the brain, and from the brain\n[emerges consciousness](../k8pg). We perceive that our brain provides\nconsciousness, and in doing so, establish a hierarchy of design. But all are at\nthe same level, they are different view points of the whole.\n\n~ p.602\n\n...\n\nIt's our tools of observation, that create the illusion that we are the prime\nobservers of nature and all entities within it. (ref: Desrosières, A. 2002 The\nPolitics of Large Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning (translated by\nCamille Naish), Cambridge, Mass: Cambridge University Press)\n\nThis is a key feature of Ethnomethodology and\n[Anchor Network Theory](../g/5c0r).\n\n~ p.603\n\n...\n\nIntersection is described as _shared attributes_.\n\n- [what is a connection?](../47ur)\n\nSpecifying first a general structure in which to fit the individual parts, only\nto then revalidate it by endless individual edge cases is common and problematic\n(given the inherit variability and complexity of data).\n\n- [Zettelkasten provides agility when processing information](../m5qg)\n- [what defines the Zettelkasten system?](../kp4q)\n\n~ p.605\n\n...\n\nThe process of zooming-in and out, along with other digital movements through\ndata sets, reveals that there is one constant entity throughout the whole\nprocess, and that is 'the whole'. From this point, 'the whole' has become a\n_simpler_ set of attributes. It is characterised by a constantly changing inner\ncomposition, but it is not a _created higher structure_ by the parts.\n\nIt is now _smaller_ than the sum of its parts, as to be part of the whole is no\nlonger a matter of 'entering into' a higher structure, but for any given entity\nto _lend part of itself_ to other entities without either of them losing their\nmultiple identities. 'The whole' is therefore an entity that is borrowing parts\nfrom all other entities at any given moment, but from the viewpoint you are\ncurrently looking from. It shares the same definition and construct of any other\nentity; it _is_ its own entity.\n\nThis concept is synthesized in\n[Zettelkasten promotes ideation due to inter-note linking](../mv04) and\naddressed with extra detail in\n[The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle, p.32](9xae)\n\n~ p.607\n\n...\n\nEach shared association to a monad creates individuality due to the previous set\nof associations always being different; n+1 so to say. This means it is\nimpossible to make a new association, and to call the association of the newly\nassociated monad to be the 'same' as it was before.\n\n~ p.608\n\n...\n\nHere using a university as an example of how the 'whole' is falsely assumed to\nbe a separate entity to its parts.\n\nEach entity might share the some of the same attributes, but they are themselves\nindividual as their attribute is contextualised by the other attributes and the\noverlapping with other monads.\n\n† An example of this is linking in Zettelkasten. Different notes can link to the\nsame second note, but the link is 'individualized' in both notes as the context\nin which it carries the reader towards the secondary note is different.\n\nIn the 1-LS approach, organisation in arises through frequency?\n\n~ p.609\n\n...\n\n\u003e 2-LS theories are often based on the contradictory idea that the macro level\n\u003e is made of virtual but stable entities while the micro level is made of real\n\u003e but transitory entities.\n\nThe frequency of associations to a particular monad, does not make it more\nimportant, it just makes it last longer\n\n~ p.610\n\n...\n\n---\n\nsource: Latour, Bruno, Pablo Jensen, Tommaso Venturini, Sébastian Grauwin, and\nDominique Boullier. “‘The Whole Is Always Smaller than Its Parts’ – a Digital\nTest of G Abriel T Ardes’ Monads.” The British Journal of Sociology 63, no. 4\n(December 2012): 590–615. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2012.01428.x.\n","wordCount":1316,"tags":["p/thesis","text","paper"],"metadata":{"aliases":[],"date":"2024-03-21 17:09","id":"szz2","people":["B.Latour"],"tags":["text","paper","p/thesis"],"title":"The Whole Is Always Smaller Than Its Parts - a Digital Test of Gabriel Tardes Monads"},"created":"2024-03-21T17:09:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:26:19.905982829Z","checksum":"0d4034d89b986b1cdd94ce86d974ac651a6a631a219561813ddf662c22316bb4"},{"filename":"e531.md","filenameStem":"e531","path":"e531.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/e531.md","title":"The Witch Trials of JK Rowling","link":"[The Witch Trials of JK Rowling](e531)","lead":"Why do we like stories about magic?","body":"Why do we like stories about magic? \n\nIt's a part of our nature to desire to have supernatural power, hidden power, secret\npower. gives us agency that we would otherwise not have. kids like this in\nparticular, as they are inherently powerless. magic and power is seductive.\n\nThe idea for Harry Potter \"fell\" into Rowlings head while on the train, out of\nnowhere ([where do creative ideas come from?](wet2)).\n\nThe reason for J.K Rowling the name, was the publishers decision.

The skills required to maintain and\n\u003e build such roads is not only more complex, but requires materials and\n\u003e machinery that a regular citizen would not have. So how much is this a result\n\u003e of a paradigmatic system, and how much is it a logical shifting of\n\u003e responsibility as the requirements of the infrastructure surpass the skillsets\n\u003e and utility of the local community? \n\n\u003e p. 242 Call to action for the state to once again \"extend its helping hand\" to\n\u003e provide some control over the development of infrasystems, as the invisible\n\u003e hand of the market cannot fulfil this task.\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- Kaijser, Arne.

Its stock is heat,\nand it has two loops seeking to drag the stock (heat); the heat of the room\nand the air temperature outside the room. The thermostat turns off when the heat\nof the room reaches the desired temperature. The heat escapes outside to the\ncooler temperature (stock flow), which causes the thermostat to turn on again.\n\n~ p.43\n\n...\n\nAny information delivered by a feedback loop can only effect future behaviour,\n*after* that information is received. There is inherent *delay*.

It describes\nevery living population and every economy.\n\nThe reinforcing loop causes growth through birth rate. The balancing loop causes\nit to shrink through death rate.\n\n† Why is the birth rate the reinforcing loop? Could it also be seen as the\nbalancing loop, while mortality is the reinforcing loop? Or is that just\nphilosophical?\n\n~ p.47\n\n...\n\nDynamic systems studies (the study of a complex system in motion) are not\ndesigned to *predict* what will happen, rather *what would happen*, if a number\nof factors unfold in a variety of ways. \n\nThey explore possible futures and ask \"what if?\" questions, which Kurzweil\ndenotes as the ability that defines us as being human ([The Singularity is Near, p.26](kk15)).\n\n† [Is our ability to understand and create systems by will, a defining factor of being human?](../cbfb)\n\n~ p.49\n\n...\n\nSystems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviours,\neven if the appearance of these structures is completely dissimilar.\n\nBoth a population and an economy can reproduce themselves.

Forrester, *Industrial Dynamics* (Cambridge, MA: The MIT\n\u003e Press, 1961), 15.\n\n~ p.36\n\n...\n\nTypes of feedback loops:\n\n- balancing loops (balancing feedback): \n    - two or more flows that react and balance each other.\n    - if you're energy is low, you can drink coffee, the energy rises and drops\n      again, you drink more coffee.\n    - [The metronome syncronicity experiment is a balancing loop?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T58lGKREubo)\n\n- runaway loops (reinforcing feedback):\n    - profits falls because investment falls, investment falls because profit\n      falls.\n    - a reinforcing feedback loop *enhances* whatever direction of change is\n      imposed on it.\n    - Kurzweil deals with this a lot in [The Singularity is Near](kk15) in so\n      far as technological advancement is a self reinforcing force.\n\n~ p.38-42\n\n...\n\nA systems thinking asks not \"who's to blame?\", but \"what's the system?\".\n\nThis definitely has place within techniques of [clear communication](../tvqr)\n\n~ p.42\n\n### Two - A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo\n\nA one-stock balancing feedback system is like a thermostat. Its stock is heat,\nand it has two loops seeking to drag the stock (heat); the heat of the room\nand the air temperature outside the room. The thermostat turns off when the heat\nof the room reaches the desired temperature. The heat escapes outside to the\ncooler temperature (stock flow), which causes the thermostat to turn on again.\n\n~ p.43\n\n...\n\nAny information delivered by a feedback loop can only effect future behaviour,\n*after* that information is received. There is inherent *delay*. This is\nimportant as it behind the cause of *oscillations* within systems, where\na change is over or under compensated because of the delay in the feedback;\nthink about a shower that has a long delay in regulating the hot water outflow.\n\n~ p.45\n\n...\n\nA system where a reinforcing and a balancing loop are both pulling on the same\nstock is one of the most command and important system structures. It describes\nevery living population and every economy.\n\nThe reinforcing loop causes growth through birth rate. The balancing loop causes\nit to shrink through death rate.\n\n† Why is the birth rate the reinforcing loop? Could it also be seen as the\nbalancing loop, while mortality is the reinforcing loop? Or is that just\nphilosophical?\n\n~ p.47\n\n...\n\nDynamic systems studies (the study of a complex system in motion) are not\ndesigned to *predict* what will happen, rather *what would happen*, if a number\nof factors unfold in a variety of ways. \n\nThey explore possible futures and ask \"what if?\" questions, which Kurzweil\ndenotes as the ability that defines us as being human ([The Singularity is Near, p.26](kk15)).\n\n† [Is our ability to understand and create systems by will, a defining factor of being human?](../cbfb)\n\n~ p.49\n\n...\n\nSystems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviours,\neven if the appearance of these structures is completely dissimilar.\n\nBoth a population and an economy can reproduce themselves. Population by birth,\nand economy by production of goods.\n\n~ p.52\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n- Meadows, D., and D. Wright. Thinking in Systems: International\n  Bestseller.

A major network in use in this creative state is the\ndefault mode network. ([study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22037421/))\n\n~ xxvii\n\n...\n\nThe \"executive attention\" network offers structured execution to the processes\nof the imagination network.\n\n~ xxviii\n\n...\n\nThe creative act typically begins with a state of \"flow\"; a complete absorption\nin the task. Here the imagination and salience networks are active. Then, the\nexecutive attention network becomes active to refine the output.\n\n~ xxix\n\n...\n\n## Chapter 3: Daydreaming\n\nOur best ideas can often come out of the blue.

Like farming and fishing, we\nhave developed ways to access the rewards of this natural resource, the\ncommodity being communication, which while may not be a core necessity to\nsurvival like eating or drinking, is a core requirement of living alongside\nothers. Wormbs however likens the radio spectrum more closely to that of\nairspace for aviation. \n\nThe point is brought forward that CBPP arose out of a necessity to adapt to fast\npaced innovation and expansion within radio technology as well as broadcasters\nthemselves understanding the need to uphold technically and morally correct\nusage of their transmitters. If their signal strayed into other broadcaster's\nfrequency, the listeners of both stations would be negatively impacted. One set\nof listeners would lose the signal, and the other set would have their content\ninvaded by the stray signal. In essence, the users would be the ones to complain\nor unsubscribe from the channel. So I would argue, that despite the broadcasters\nacting in a CBPP way, they're ultimately using the satisfaction of their\nlistenerships as a vehicle to drive the collaborative method forward. \n\nWW2 damaged the previously functioning moral economy out of broken relations\nbetween countries as well as Germany's removal from the representational body of\ncountries who made up the post war broadcasting commissions European\nBroadcasting Union and Organisation International de Radiodifusion. The\nCopenhagen plan was established, but it so undersupplied what each occupying\nnation wanted, that they almost all ignored the plan and instead did as they\ndeemed necessary for their broadcasting requirements. However, it was not a full\nfree-for-all. Ad hoc mutual agreements did get established by neighbours so as\nto mitigate signal interference, showing a return to a style of collaboration\nseen pre-war. \n\nWorbs concludes by calling for a renewed activity in the installation of a moral\neconomy created by a collective commons approach.\n\n\u003e p. 98 Approaching the radio spectrum as a \"natural resource\" \n\n\u003e p. 98 The way in which the radio spectrum was regulated in Sweden constitutes\n\u003e a so called \"moral economy embedded in what we are calling a cosmopolitan\n\u003e commons\". Wormbs aims to support this argument through empirical evidence of\n\u003e the institutionalisation of frequency plans for European broadcasting between\n\u003e 1920s and 1950s.\n---\n\u003e \"communities of fate\" are groups of people who overlap political borders,\n\u003e depend on technologies and involve the actions of nature itself. (what is that\n\u003e supposed to mean; involve the actions of nature itself?)\n---\n\u003e Radio as a communication technology was built by the commons, for the commons.\n\u003e As a result, when the system was changed, for example when a broadcasting\n\u003e frequency was changed, the communication experience of many was effected. This\n\u003e created a community environment around communications. \n\n\u003e p. 99 The radio spectrum is a resource more closely related to airspace than\n\u003e to grazing lands, rivers, or lakes. \n\n\u003e p. 102 The radio spectrum is defined as a natural resource based on the fact\n\u003e that radio frequencies operate according to the natural properties of the\n\u003e earth; namely the earths magnetic field and properties of the atmosphere.\n\u003e Therefore the radio spectrum is an element of the natural world and exists\n\u003e with or without our technological capabilities to sense it. \n\n\u003e p. 103 During the advent of radio, there was concern as how to provide enough\n\u003e coverage to greater Europe. A 'tiling' solution was considered, essentially\n\u003e systematically and evenly covering Europe's landmass, but due to the uneven\n\u003e distribution of population, this was not optimal. By this time, there were\n\u003e already numerous broadcasters online, and they were resistant to change. But\n\u003e they came to realise that cooperation was not only necessary, but beneficial.\n\u003e Wormbs calls this process, \"building a moral economy\"\n\n\u003e p. 104 - 105 Wormbs suggests that the example of radio wave assignment that\n\u003e took place in 1926 was \"fair\" as countries that did not even have radio\n\u003e services were assigned one singular band. However other European countries,\n\u003e all who already had radio bands, received differing amounts of assignments;\n\u003e Germany claiming the most with 12. I'm not sure this is \"fair\", as the\n\u003e variation in assignments can be seen as a type of control, much the same as\n\u003e the distribution, development and upgrades of the internet's physical layer\n\u003e shows. See [James Bridle](../g/5m5r). \n\n\u003e p. 108 In the early period of broadcasting, it was evident that it relied\n\u003e heavily on a commons based production method. Transmitter technology was of\n\u003e varying quality and the effort to consider the importance of this was the\n\u003e central point of CBPP. A transmitter of poor quality would allow its signal to\n\u003e drift into other frequency bands. This not only impacted the listening\n\u003e experience of listeners to that station, but also the listeners of\n\u003e neighbouring frequencies.

Like farming and fishing, we\nhave developed ways to access the rewards of this natural resource, the\ncommodity being communication, which while may not be a core necessity to\nsurvival like eating or drinking, is a core requirement of living alongside\nothers. Wormbs however likens the radio spectrum more closely to that of\nairspace for aviation. \n\nThe point is brought forward that CBPP arose out of a necessity to adapt to fast\npaced innovation and expansion within radio technology as well as broadcasters\nthemselves understanding the need to uphold technically and morally correct\nusage of their transmitters. If their signal strayed into other broadcaster's\nfrequency, the listeners of both stations would be negatively impacted. One set\nof listeners would lose the signal, and the other set would have their content\ninvaded by the stray signal. In essence, the users would be the ones to complain\nor unsubscribe from the channel. So I would argue, that despite the broadcasters\nacting in a CBPP way, they're ultimately using the satisfaction of their\nlistenerships as a vehicle to drive the collaborative method forward. \n\nWW2 damaged the previously functioning moral economy out of broken relations\nbetween countries as well as Germany's removal from the representational body of\ncountries who made up the post war broadcasting commissions European\nBroadcasting Union and Organisation International de Radiodifusion. The\nCopenhagen plan was established, but it so undersupplied what each occupying\nnation wanted, that they almost all ignored the plan and instead did as they\ndeemed necessary for their broadcasting requirements. However, it was not a full\nfree-for-all. Ad hoc mutual agreements did get established by neighbours so as\nto mitigate signal interference, showing a return to a style of collaboration\nseen pre-war. \n\nWorbs concludes by calling for a renewed activity in the installation of a moral\neconomy created by a collective commons approach.\n\n\u003e p. 98 Approaching the radio spectrum as a \"natural resource\" \n\n\u003e p. 98 The way in which the radio spectrum was regulated in Sweden constitutes\n\u003e a so called \"moral economy embedded in what we are calling a cosmopolitan\n\u003e commons\". Wormbs aims to support this argument through empirical evidence of\n\u003e the institutionalisation of frequency plans for European broadcasting between\n\u003e 1920s and 1950s.\n---\n\u003e \"communities of fate\" are groups of people who overlap political borders,\n\u003e depend on technologies and involve the actions of nature itself. (what is that\n\u003e supposed to mean; involve the actions of nature itself?)\n---\n\u003e Radio as a communication technology was built by the commons, for the commons.\n\u003e As a result, when the system was changed, for example when a broadcasting\n\u003e frequency was changed, the communication experience of many was effected. This\n\u003e created a community environment around communications. \n\n\u003e p. 99 The radio spectrum is a resource more closely related to airspace than\n\u003e to grazing lands, rivers, or lakes. \n\n\u003e p. 102 The radio spectrum is defined as a natural resource based on the fact\n\u003e that radio frequencies operate according to the natural properties of the\n\u003e earth; namely the earths magnetic field and properties of the atmosphere.\n\u003e Therefore the radio spectrum is an element of the natural world and exists\n\u003e with or without our technological capabilities to sense it. \n\n\u003e p. 103 During the advent of radio, there was concern as how to provide enough\n\u003e coverage to greater Europe. A 'tiling' solution was considered, essentially\n\u003e systematically and evenly covering Europe's landmass, but due to the uneven\n\u003e distribution of population, this was not optimal. By this time, there were\n\u003e already numerous broadcasters online, and they were resistant to change. But\n\u003e they came to realise that cooperation was not only necessary, but beneficial.\n\u003e Wormbs calls this process, \"building a moral economy\"\n\n\u003e p. 104 - 105 Wormbs suggests that the example of radio wave assignment that\n\u003e took place in 1926 was \"fair\" as countries that did not even have radio\n\u003e services were assigned one singular band. However other European countries,\n\u003e all who already had radio bands, received differing amounts of assignments;\n\u003e Germany claiming the most with 12. I'm not sure this is \"fair\", as the\n\u003e variation in assignments can be seen as a type of control, much the same as\n\u003e the distribution, development and upgrades of the internet's physical layer\n\u003e shows. See [James Bridle](../g/5m5r). \n\n\u003e p. 108 In the early period of broadcasting, it was evident that it relied\n\u003e heavily on a commons based production method. Transmitter technology was of\n\u003e varying quality and the effort to consider the importance of this was the\n\u003e central point of CBPP. A transmitter of poor quality would allow its signal to\n\u003e drift into other frequency bands. This not only impacted the listening\n\u003e experience of listeners to that station, but also the listeners of\n\u003e neighbouring frequencies. Because of this, it was communally understood that\n\u003e every broadcaster needed to pay attention to their transmitter quality, both\n\u003e for their sake and others. \n\n\u003e p. 109 It was through the fast rate of technological development of radio\n\u003e broadcasting that the regulatory organisations surrounding broadcasting fell\n\u003e into a [commons-based production](../2o9k) form of working.

This promotes the opportunity in revealing novel connections,\nidentified through _shared attributes_ ([what is a connection?](47ur)), and in\ndoing so provides a pathway to synthesizing those connections into a new idea.\n\n---\n\nsource:\n[how does the Zettelkasten system promote creative thinking?](t5v3)\n\nreferences:\n\n- [Zettelkasten and network graphs support creative ideation by offering interactive systems of interconnected data](50p9)\n","wordCount":244,"tags":["seed","pos","p/thesis"],"metadata":{"aliases":[],"date":"2024-03-28 14:06","id":"mv04","people":[],"tags":["seed","pos","p/thesis"],"title":"Zettelkasten promotes ideation due to inter-note linking"},"created":"2024-03-28T14:06:00Z","modified":"2024-05-13T05:53:09.773459537Z","checksum":"6bb8dab489a37a39e46d8514677aecb60f2b972ef54066fc6a32bcf355d201b5"},{"filename":"m5qg.md","filenameStem":"m5qg","path":"m5qg.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/m5qg.md","title":"Zettelkasten provides agility when processing information","link":"[Zettelkasten provides agility when processing information](m5qg)","lead":"# Zettelkasten provides agility when processing information","body":"# Zettelkasten provides agility when processing information\n\nThis became apparent to me on 2024-01-28 after mum sent me a particularly\ninteresting article,\n[what if general artificial intelligence became conscious?](r/6m37).\n\nWe encounter a huge variety of information, exacerbated by the internet with the\naccess that it provides.

How does the Zettelkasten method help creative ideation?\n2. [What connections are there between the Zettelkasten system and creative ideation](../it61)?\n3. How can ML enabled features be integrated into the `zk` Zettelkasten workflow\n   to support creative ideation?\n\n## 1. [Introduction and Motivation](../w384) - pages ~2\n\n- Why am I interested in undertaking this research topic, both theoretical and\n  practical? And what does the research stand to provide?\n  - Theoretical: literature review in search of the intersections between\n    Zettelkasten and creative ideation.\n  - Practical: practice based research in implementing the insights gained\n    through literature research, within a software product.\n  - Result: a software product that should support the quality of creative\n    ideation for users of the Zettelkasten system along with a theoretical\n    backing of why it helps.\n\n### 1.1 Scope\n\n- Define the issues of scope with the project as well as its limitations and how\n  they will be addressed (creative thinking is itself an unwieldy topic itself,\n  its depth and nuance cannot be addressed within the scope of this thesis).\n\n## 2. Background - pages ~10 (inc. subsections)\n\nNote: in\n[ideation is what emerges from the translation of data between actants](../3cta)\nI've tied together the topics of [connectionism](../g/0d9n) and\n[Actor-Network Theory](../g/5c0r) to describe the roles of information\ntransferal between nodes contributing to an emergent product.

A simple representation of the Data Lineage can be shown with dots and lines, where dot represents a data container for data points and lines connecting them represents the transformations the data point undergoes, between the data containers.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20lineage)\n","wordCount":222,"tags":["glossary"],"metadata":{"date":"2023-10-31","tags":["glossary"]},"created":"2023-10-31T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:22:29.131924779Z","checksum":"bdeeb3f3b68f64cde7dc5e2572dc776ef5fe1c9be7f341ba3cdf3f6ce18c08e8"},{"filename":"8qcs.md","filenameStem":"8qcs","path":"8qcs.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/8qcs.md","title":"data visualisation is a process of intuitive simplification","link":"[data visualisation is a process of intuitive simplification](8qcs)","lead":"# data visualisation is a process of intuitive simplification","body":"# data visualisation is a process of intuitive simplification\n\nVisualising a data set, is a process of simplification as the process itself \nexists for us to comprehend that which is too complex to comprehend in the \nfirst place.\n\nTherein lies the intuition.

It is a practice\nof meditation that is universal in that everyone has access to it. You don't\nneed to pay someone to provide you with your own special mantra (no access for\nthe poor), to visualise an image (no access for the blind), or to sit or move\nin any particular way (no access for physically challenged). The technique is\ngrounded in experiencing the present moment through observation of bodily\nsensations, something that everyone has access to [^1].\n\nThe following is my understanding of the philosophies of Vipassana meditation\nand how they interface with our daily life and nature as a whole.\nAs context, you can read a text [here](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/art) based on a\ntalk by [S.N Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/goenka), who was a leader\nin the teaching of Vipassana from 1969-2013. \n\nI comment a little bit on the ten day course I completed in June 2023, but in\nkeeping with the correct way of introducing people to the course - I do not\nwant to influence too much or create too much of an image.\n\nThe TL;DR for the Vipassana course itself is that it was mentally and\nphysically challenging but very educational and rewarding. The two advices I would give is 1)\nanyone considering to undertake a course should first establish a \npractice of regular mindfulness meditation and be comfortable to sit on the ground\nwith legs crossed. This is more so that you can take best advantage of the\nunique experience and environment of a Vipassana course, and not have to spend\nall your time battling physical discomfort. And 2) to just wait until you feel like it's \na good time to do it. There's no need to rush. It will pay off much more if it's done \nwhen it wants to be done.\n\n## The Retreat\n\nI did my course in Sweden at [Dhamma Sobhana](https://sobhana.dhamma.org/).\nThe environment was a manifestation of tranquility itself. To be found were\nwell kept gardens, small forest areas with varieties of beautiful flowers,\nwinding paths and cosy red cottages with white outlines. Time is defined by the\nsoft striking of two gongs. One for the male students, another for the female,\na perfect fourth interval apart, creating a slowly phasing ambient rhythm that\nis heard anywhere in the compound. Beds are comfortable, food is wholesome and\namenities just fine. \n\nThe noble silence was an interesting and special experience. On the arrival\nday, you meet everyone and can get to know each other, then from 20:00 the\nnoble silence begins. The nine days that follow you may not talk or communicate\nwith other students in any way. No gesturing, writing or signalling. This helps\na lot with being able to stay in the meditational focus and frame of mind\nrequired to make the meditation sessions more fluid. It also reduces the mental\nfriction that can occur if students compare their experiences with each other\nthroughout the week. This can lead to comparison between ones self and others,\nwhich has no useful place in meditational practice at all. The meditation is\nyour experience. The yard stick is your equanimity. \n\nThe most profound thing about the silence though is, upon the last day when the\nsilence is lifted, how much more you know each other despite not having talked\nsince day one. Everyone feels like close friends. This no doubt comes through\nthe sharing of the challenging experience, and living in close quarters with\neach other. It was very interesting to experience how a strong sense of solidarity \nand friendship can still occur in near total lack of communication, vocal or otherwise. \n\nI considered a few times that it could be an interesting exercise for teams of \nsoftware developers to spend some days (maybe not ten) in a retreat, where they cannot \ncommunicate with each other at all, but need to live together and also work on a programming \ntask. The value would lie in the interpersonal and social developments that come from a form \nof interaction that is outside of the normal and mundane (like the uncomfortable exercise \nof two people being tasked to stare for two minutes directly into each others eyes without \naverting their gazes. Anyone who's done this, realises a strange sense of 'knowing' the person afterward, \ndespite having exchanged no words). \n\nVipassana retreats can be anywhere from three days to fourty-five. Ten days \nis the standard and recommended length. During these ten days, you essentially \nlive the life of a monk or nun. You don't speak, you eat the food that is prepared \nfor you and you follow a set schedule of meditation and break times. \n\nIt's demanding, physically and mentally. Eleven hours meditation every day\nrequires the body to be accustomed to sitting on the floor without unbearable\nor increasing discomfort. And to focus continuously for ten days is strenuous\nin of itself, despite the focus not being on an analytical task. You do\nencounter then, a form of mental exhaustion, and it's made worse when you\nindulge in questioning how many days are left and how difficult will those days\nincreasingly be. But this is just as much part of the practice. To disengage\nfrom those thoughts of aversion and craving, and the tension they bring, and to\nreturn to the true reality of you being where you are, moment to moment.\n\n## The Technique\n\nOn the forth day the main Vipassana technique, Pañña, is taught. It's the\npractice of observing sensations in the body and remaining equanimous with\nthem. This means to not judge them as being pleasurable or unpleasurable,\ndesirable or undesirable, wanted or unwanted. By practicing this equanimity,\nthe behavioural pattern of the mind, which seeks to generate craving (pleasure)\nand aversion (displeasure), becomes weakened. The generation of craving or\naversion leads to attachment; we become attached to something desirable\nhappening, or something undesirable not happening. When the opposite happens,\nand what we want to happen does not eventuate, we encounter misery. \n\nWith this, Buddha concluded that craving and aversion are the root cause of all\nmisery and to become fully enlightened, one must rid themselves of all craving\nand aversion. At this point, a lot of people get demotivated from the\nphilosophy. *This is a path only for some*. The rest of us can move somewhere\nalong the path and stop at whatever point is sustainable. That is the best\ncollective result for society. It does not need to be all or nothing. You \ncan still have sex (even with yourself), or do \u003cinsert naughty thing\u003e. The idea \nis to become a *better* person, not to become Buddha. You can actually bake the cake \nand eat it too in this case, you just wont assimilate into the universe.\n\nVipassana teaches that each and every reaction we elicit, mental or physical,\nbegins with a sensation in the body. The sensations in the body arise from the\nunconscious mind, that is its domain; the autonomous faculties of mind and\nmatter. By training ourselves to calm our outer layer, the conscious mind, and\nto maintain awareness of bodily sensations as they rise and pass away, we are\ntraining an ability to integrate an awareness into our every day life. When we\nsubsequently find ourselves in any situation, and we have a good practice of\nVipassana established (being equanimous), we can become aware of a sensation in\nthe body as they occur. With the awareness of that sensation, we can then react\nmore wisely than we otherwise would, as our reactions otherwise would be just\nthat - reactions, not considerations. \n\n## Anicca, The Law of Impermanence\n\nFrom this comes the emergence of a compassion for all life an all beings,\nbecause all life, including ourselves, exists within the same universal law of\nimpermanence. All things change. Because all things change, all things are\nimpermanent, ultimate truth cannot exist in the generation of craving or\naversion. Craving *can* remain permanent, as can aversion. They feed themselves\nand only grow more hungry. This is incongruous with the universal law of\nimpermanence. It places you on a divergent path to that of true nature, which\nultimately generates misery for you, as you are diverging yourself from nature.  \n\nGenerating craving or aversion (sankahra) is the process of desiring reality to\nbe something it is not. Vipassana teaches the practitioner to observe reality\nas it is, which brings tranquility and peace to the experience of reality. This\ndoes not mean that we can't desire things. Or that if we desire things or want\nthings to be different, that we will only generate misery. Of course in\nessence, it does work this way and becomes clearer when you take the extreme as\nan example: If you always desire a different reality than your own, then your\nreality will be misery, because day after day, year after year it is not what\nyou want. This is a disease that plagues many people who are focussed on\ngenerating wealth and power for the sake of wealth and power. It leads to never\nbeing satisfied, because there is always more to be had. Drug addiction\nworks the same, it's just the object of the craving is different. \n\nWe can still desire things, and to be excited about things eventuating. **The\nmeasure of how much misery this brings to your life is how much tension you\nexperience waiting for the thing to eventuate and how equanimous you remain\nwhen that desire does not eventuate.** If you experience no tension while\nwaiting for the thing to eventuate; meaning you are present in each moment up\nuntil it eventuates or not, and if you do not react with frustration, anger,\ndisappointment or such when it does not eventuate; then you are living a life\ncloser to real peace and harmony. A life of equanimity. \n\nPure Vipassana theory would say that you should also not experience elation or\neuphoria when the thing *does* occur. On the outset, this does not sound\nappropriate. However, feeling elation, euphoria or other such extreme\n\"positive\" feelings, are the *result* of a craving being satisfied. If you were\nto feel elation, euphoria or such feelings when the thing eventuates, you would\nequally feel devastation, anger, resentment or such feelings if it did not\neventuate. With each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n\n## A Sense of Realism?\n\nIt is however important to remember that nature and life could not exist\nwithout sankahra. Reproduction is fuelled by sankahra. Nature is perfect, but\nalso imperfect. It is cruel and kind. We can also not simply conclude that a\nlife completely void of sankahra which an enlightened person achieves, should\nbe hailed as the true destination of happiness and prosperity for all humans. If all\nhumans achieved this, we would stop reproducing. It would be an extinction\nevent. However, it would arguably be better for all other beings and plants\non earth if humans became extinct. Everything else suffers by our existence (except \nviruses). \n\nThe paradox here I suppose is that if all humans did become enlightened, no one\nwould have a problem with the human race becoming extinct within a generation,\nas we would all be one with nature anyway. We would be totally and collectively\nat peace with death and the ultimate truth of nature, meaning we would not be\ncompelled to reproduce - a partial process of immortalising ourselves by passing\nfragments of ourselves down to our children. \n\nAt this point it is theory. Just reading the concepts can never lead to an\naccurate conclusion of its truth. It needs to be experienced itself. And this\ncomes full circle to the essence of the Vipassana technique being a universal\ntruth. It is a practice that is universally true for each and every human\nbeing. The practice is to experience one's own reality as it is, not as one\nwishes it to be. There is no exclusivity in the accessibility to this truth or\nultimately to enlightenment. It is universal, and nature is universal. No one\nis more or less resultant from nature than anyone else. Anyone can experience\nthe benefits of Vipassana because everyone has universal access to the truth of\nnature through the manifestation of sensations of the body.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is different from other modifications of the technique\nsuch as transcendental meditation, which requires the practitioner be given a\nmantra. A special and supposedly unique word, which only a guru can give. The\nprovision of this mantra, carries the burden of secrecy whereby the\npractitioner cannot reveal the mantra to anyone else, or else the mantra will\nloose its essence. While using the mantra as a source of focus for meditation\ndoes calm and focus the mind, it does not allow the practitioner to access the\npure truth of themselves and their place in nature. This is because they are\nthemselves generating an alternate reality for themselves by repeating a secret\nword. This by definition is *not* a universal truth. If each practitioner of\ntranscendental meditation is given a unique word, then each practitioner is\nexperiencing a reality that is divergent from their true reality when they\nmeditate, the reality as it is, not as they (through repetition of mantra) wish\nit to be. By diverging from nature in a meditational practice, one can never\ntruly access nature at its core. Only the surface, a calming of the mind and an\nenhanced focus, will be reached. \n\n\n[^1] I did some research for cases where people may lose the ability to perceive \nall perception of sensations in the body, but did not find anything. Only partial loss in sensation. \nIf I'm wrong, please email me!","snippets":["## Vipassana"],"rawContent":"---\ndate: 2023-06-18\ntags:\n  - seed\n---\n# first Vipassana retreat\n\n\n## Vipassana\n\nVipassana is the original, unaltered meditation technique of \"The Buddha\" (as we were\ntaught, any enlightened person is Buddha), Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practice\nof meditation that is universal in that everyone has access to it. You don't\nneed to pay someone to provide you with your own special mantra (no access for\nthe poor), to visualise an image (no access for the blind), or to sit or move\nin any particular way (no access for physically challenged). The technique is\ngrounded in experiencing the present moment through observation of bodily\nsensations, something that everyone has access to [^1].\n\nThe following is my understanding of the philosophies of Vipassana meditation\nand how they interface with our daily life and nature as a whole.\nAs context, you can read a text [here](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/art) based on a\ntalk by [S.N Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/goenka), who was a leader\nin the teaching of Vipassana from 1969-2013. \n\nI comment a little bit on the ten day course I completed in June 2023, but in\nkeeping with the correct way of introducing people to the course - I do not\nwant to influence too much or create too much of an image.\n\nThe TL;DR for the Vipassana course itself is that it was mentally and\nphysically challenging but very educational and rewarding. The two advices I would give is 1)\nanyone considering to undertake a course should first establish a \npractice of regular mindfulness meditation and be comfortable to sit on the ground\nwith legs crossed. This is more so that you can take best advantage of the\nunique experience and environment of a Vipassana course, and not have to spend\nall your time battling physical discomfort. And 2) to just wait until you feel like it's \na good time to do it. There's no need to rush. It will pay off much more if it's done \nwhen it wants to be done.\n\n## The Retreat\n\nI did my course in Sweden at [Dhamma Sobhana](https://sobhana.dhamma.org/).\nThe environment was a manifestation of tranquility itself. To be found were\nwell kept gardens, small forest areas with varieties of beautiful flowers,\nwinding paths and cosy red cottages with white outlines. Time is defined by the\nsoft striking of two gongs. One for the male students, another for the female,\na perfect fourth interval apart, creating a slowly phasing ambient rhythm that\nis heard anywhere in the compound. Beds are comfortable, food is wholesome and\namenities just fine. \n\nThe noble silence was an interesting and special experience. On the arrival\nday, you meet everyone and can get to know each other, then from 20:00 the\nnoble silence begins. The nine days that follow you may not talk or communicate\nwith other students in any way. No gesturing, writing or signalling. This helps\na lot with being able to stay in the meditational focus and frame of mind\nrequired to make the meditation sessions more fluid. It also reduces the mental\nfriction that can occur if students compare their experiences with each other\nthroughout the week. This can lead to comparison between ones self and others,\nwhich has no useful place in meditational practice at all. The meditation is\nyour experience. The yard stick is your equanimity. \n\nThe most profound thing about the silence though is, upon the last day when the\nsilence is lifted, how much more you know each other despite not having talked\nsince day one.

This is achieved by representing the list as an implicit tree, where the value of each node is the sum of the numbers in that subtree.\n\nAn API should say what **every exported function** does. ie, what happens when no input is given, or too many imputs.\n\n## Dont tell them how it works\n\nIf possible, an API _should not_ reveal any implementation details.\nIn other words, only include under-the-hood information if it's required to fully be able to use the thing.\n\n## Grant them the right to use it\n\nMIT license:\n\n\u003e \"you can use my code for free, and you can close source it, but you can't sue me\"\n\nApache license:\n\n\u003e like the MIT license, but more wordy and specific\n\nGPL licenses:\n\n\u003e \"my code is open sourced, and you can use my code, but if you do it has to remain open sourced and either publicly viewable or available on request\"\n\n## Don't change it\n\nYour software needs to be backwards compatible. This means that you can improve code, but you should not change its functionality. Doing so will break peoples code.\nAlong with this the API needs to remain available and accessible.\n\nTo communicate this you should explain your _compatability policy_ and _semantic versioning_ like below:\n\n\u003e Roadmap\n\u003e The API of this library is frozen.\n\u003e Version numbers adhere to semantic versioning.\n\u003e The only accepted reason to modify the API of this package is to handle issues that can't be resolved in any other reasonable way.\n\nSemantic versioning is a convention for specifying compatibility. It uses a three-part versioning number:\n\n\u003e major.minor.patch\n\n- major = when you make incompatible API changes\n- minor = when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner\n- patch = when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n\nWhen it's decided that a function should not be used anymore, eg when it's superseeded by something else. The original function becomes _deprecated_.\n\n## Don't use a lot where a little will do\n\nThis is referring to the code itself.

There is a big pit fall in quantified data,\nwhere if the system is not set up sufficiently, it may just show trends,\nwithout much availability to analyse the relationships of those trends or which\nexternal variables are affecting them. \n\n\nHow can you develop a better sensetivity to the inner state of ones self? \n\n- meditation\n- therapy\n- psychadelic medicines\n- Psychedelic Therapy\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n- [Quantified Self to the Extreme](r/khzz)\n\n\n","wordCount":195,"tags":["seed"],"metadata":{"aliases":null,"date":"2022-10-31","tags":["seed"]},"created":"2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:21:24.26733037Z","checksum":"e4df37bb3b6e414377fc935275f4b0d0f441120882b9fc328d08e4e3d374588b"},{"filename":"sg6k.md","filenameStem":"sg6k","path":"sg6k.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/sg6k.md","title":"quest for convenience","link":"[quest for convenience](sg6k)","lead":"# quest for convenience","body":"# quest for convenience\n\nThe quest for convenience drives innovation.

This case of chance piqued his curiosity and on April\n19, 1943 Hofmann ingested an \"infinitesimal dose\" of LSD and while riding home\non his bike from the lab, experienced the first acid trip ever.\n\n\u003e _\"In the realm of scientific observation, luck is granted only to those who\n\u003e are prepared\"_ - Louis Pasteur\n\nYou don't need luck, luck needs you.\n\n---\n\nSource: https://tjex.net/blog/2024/you-dont-need-luck-luck-needs-you/","snippets":["\u003e [Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity](1ifd)\n\u003e\n\u003e - Seneca ([disputed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger))"],"rawContent":"---\ntitle: you don't need luck, luck needs you\ndate: 2024-05-15 11:27\nid: b7mo\ntags: [text, post, syn]\naliases: []\npeople: [Jex.T]\n---\n\n\u003e [Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity](1ifd)\n\u003e\n\u003e - Seneca ([disputed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger))\n\nOften someone will describe success as requiring a collection of abilities\nincluding, but not limited to: determination, dedication, an open mind,\nstructure, healthy habits, practice, focus, etc. But what seemingly _always_\nget's included is \"a little luck\".

Can\nyou recognise it when it comes your way, and will you be prepared when it does?\n\nIn [Wired to Create](r/b3eq) Kaufman and Gregoire recount how opportunity and\npreparedness forged a crystalline unit of luck, sending Albert Hofman on a bike\nride he would never forget.\n\nIn his 1983 memoir\n[_LSD: My Problem Child_](https://archive.org/details/lsdmyproblemchil0000hofm_g1j0),\nHofman wrote, \"I could not forget the relatively uninteresting LSD-25\", \"A\npeculiar presentiment...induced me, five years after the first synthesis, to\nproduce LSD-25 once again so that a sample could be given to the pharmacological\ndepartment for further tests.\"[^1]\n\nIn the final stages of crystallizing the sample that would be sent to the\ndepartment, the smallest of doses dropped on his hand, making him feel a bit\nstrange and go home sick. This case of chance piqued his curiosity and on April\n19, 1943 Hofmann ingested an \"infinitesimal dose\" of LSD and while riding home\non his bike from the lab, experienced the first acid trip ever.\n\n\u003e _\"In the realm of scientific observation, luck is granted only to those who\n\u003e are prepared\"_ - Louis Pasteur\n\nYou don't need luck, luck needs you.\n\n---\n\nSource: https://tjex.net/blog/2024/you-dont-need-luck-luck-needs-you/\n","wordCount":610,"tags":["text","post","syn"],"metadata":{"aliases":[],"date":"2024-05-15 11:27","id":"b7mo","people":["Jex.T"],"tags":["text","post","syn"],"title":"you don't need luck, luck needs you"},"created":"2024-05-15T11:27:00Z","modified":"2024-07-17T06:26:19.896976073Z","checksum":"7609dba27ee78cf9fe69287e67bc42ff30aa50c2f1ab7280c1555a94355ac260"},{"filename":"jeg4.md","filenameStem":"jeg4","path":"jeg4.md","absPath":"/Users/tjex/wikis/ps/jeg4.md","title":"your awareness of connection to organic spirit","link":"[your awareness of connection to organic spirit](jeg4)","lead":"This is something that you train by doing and through meditation.
