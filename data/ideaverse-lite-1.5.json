If you're at a computer screen, this means closing tabs and applications and eliminating things that are robbing your attention.\n4. **Take a deep breath, take a walk, change your environment** — Whether it's burnout, lowered energy from sitting too much, or just feeling overwhelm; knowing when (and how) to change things up is a crucial skill for many things—including for recentering so you can once again find flow. (Main Element: [[Energy (re Flow)]], [[Attention (re Flow)]])\n5. **Tie your present activity to your goals in some way** — More often than not, we find ourselves doing something we wish we weren't doing. Try to find a way to relate the activity to your goals in some way. (Main Elements: [[Direction (re Flow)]], [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]])\n    - **Make a game out of it** — So you really don't see any strong connection between your activity and your goals, so you just can't seem to summon the enthusiasm for it. So try making a game out of it. How fast can you get the task done with complete focus and zero distractions? If it's an event with people, maybe try to get into a few higher, quality, deeper conversations; or maybe just make a game out of asking really good questions. (Main Elements: [[Direction (re Flow)]], [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]])\n6. **Sleep well. Eat Well. Hydrate well** — If your energy is low because you've somehow neglected taking care of yourself, then it will be much harder to induce flow because low energy means decreased mood and increased distractibility.

It occurred to us that all new information or ideas must support, extend, or challenge existing ideas or information you already have and that has led to those verbs being cognitive tools for students” Bob Bain\n\n%%\nThis effort to encourage active, engaged thinking relates to the mindset behind Evergreen notes, namely that [[Evergreen notes compound in value over time]].\n%%\n\n---\n\"Years ago, we were working on an R\u0026D project in curriculum with high school students in Detroit. The students “read” texts just as I did when I was in high school – skimming it to find sentences to copy to “answer” teacher assigned or questions at back of text. I don’t think I ever read a complete chapter while a high school student, simply skimmed and copied enough to get me a check or a “C”. No active reader or thinker I, but active skimmer! I “studented” my way through high school, not learning much. And we were seeing “studenting” among students with whom we were working.\n\nWe puzzled over what made more thoughtful, active readers and started tracking briefly our “no-longer-studenting” reading practices. We concluded that before reading something we had some theory or conjecture about what we’d find there, no matter how vague or naïve. Then, what we were reading either “supported” or “extended” or \"challenged’ our pre-reading ideas.\n\nNo great insight, really, as others like Piaget had asserted similar things in a far more nuanced language (assimilation/ assimilating and accommodation/accommodating ).\n\nHowever, my colleagues and I wondered if we could turn those thinking verbs – support, extend, challenge – into cognitive tools students could use to do less studenting and more thinking when reading.\n\nSo, we trialed a new approach to assigned reading in our R\u0026D work:\n\n1. Asked students first for a freewrite conjecture about the topic so students could see what they thought.\n2. Then assigned reading by asking students to identify or explain how the text “supported,” “extended” or “challenged” their thinking.\n\nTurned out to have some power. Students began to look at texts in relation to their thinking and not some pre-packaged questions teachers asked.\n\nWe’ve used this in every curricular project since (about 18 years of it).

It occurred to us that all new information or ideas must support, extend, or challenge existing ideas or information you already have and that has led to those verbs being cognitive tools for students” Bob Bain\n\n%%\nThis effort to encourage active, engaged thinking relates to the mindset behind Evergreen notes, namely that [[Evergreen notes compound in value over time]].\n%%\n\n---\n\"Years ago, we were working on an R\u0026D project in curriculum with high school students in Detroit. The students “read” texts just as I did when I was in high school – skimming it to find sentences to copy to “answer” teacher assigned or questions at back of text. I don’t think I ever read a complete chapter while a high school student, simply skimmed and copied enough to get me a check or a “C”. No active reader or thinker I, but active skimmer! I “studented” my way through high school, not learning much. And we were seeing “studenting” among students with whom we were working.\n\nWe puzzled over what made more thoughtful, active readers and started tracking briefly our “no-longer-studenting” reading practices. We concluded that before reading something we had some theory or conjecture about what we’d find there, no matter how vague or naïve. Then, what we were reading either “supported” or “extended” or \"challenged’ our pre-reading ideas.\n\nNo great insight, really, as others like Piaget had asserted similar things in a far more nuanced language (assimilation/ assimilating and accommodation/accommodating ).\n\nHowever, my colleagues and I wondered if we could turn those thinking verbs – support, extend, challenge – into cognitive tools students could use to do less studenting and more thinking when reading.\n\nSo, we trialed a new approach to assigned reading in our R\u0026D work:\n\n1. Asked students first for a freewrite conjecture about the topic so students could see what they thought.\n2. Then assigned reading by asking students to identify or explain how the text “supported,” “extended” or “challenged” their thinking.\n\nTurned out to have some power. Students began to look at texts in relation to their thinking and not some pre-packaged questions teachers asked.\n\nWe’ve used this in every curricular project since (about 18 years of it). I use in my own teaching, often employing those verbs when reading multiple texts (e.g., how does Dewey’s essay support, extend, or challenge piece by Thorndike? In what ways do they support, extend, or challenge your thinking about learning?)\n\nOn last thing: I use those verbs in my re-purposing my notes when working in earnest on a problem I need to write about or teach.

It is concluded that viewing self‐control strength in cognitive control terms has considerable merit. Social, cognitive, personality, and clinical sources of data are integrated in the analysis.\n\t- why: \n\n#### Extracted Annotations (3/7/2015, 4:26:55 PM)\n\n\"William James (1890) was among the first psychologists to highlight the importance of self-control to adaptive functioning.\" (Robinson et al 2010:189)\n\n\"The self-control and cognitive control literatures, thus, would seem to overlap considerably in their mutual concern with the person's ability to inhibit dominant responses in a task-defined or otherwise strategic manner (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001; van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"In neurocognitive terms, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in monitoring problematic processing and behavioral occurrences (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006), whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in instantiating cognitive control in a goal-directed (rather than habitual) manner (Kerns et al., 2004; Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"we suggest that self-control is probably not special, but rather borrows from a general-purpose brain-based system related to concern with, monitoring of, and remediation of problematic events and behaviors of multiple types (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"An energizer of the cognitive control system is motivation (Sarter, Gehring, \u0026 Kozak, 2006). Stated in other terms, if there is low motivation to control a problematic tendency, it is unlikely that the cognitive control system of the prefrontal cortex will be recruited. This in turn would result in suboptimal performance (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Thus, one major component to self-control strength is likely one's willingness to work hard on a difficult task.\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Potentially separable from self-control capacity or even task motivation is what we term task monitoring. To perform non-habitual tasks well, potential or actual mistakes must be recognized. In the absence of recognizing error-proneness, cognitive and behavioral habits would dominate (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005)\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Although many of these habits would generally serve the self, many would not (Bargh \u0026 Chartrand, 1999).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192) ^309fcc\n\n\"The success (versus failure) of cognitive control is primarily a result of dlPFC activation (Kerns et al., 2004) and the processes uniquely implemented by this brain structure (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Note that these consequences of dlPFC damage are highly consistent with impaired self-control as highlighted by the strength-based theory of self-control (Baumeister et al., 2000). Thus, it is suggested that the recruitment of the dlPFC's resources should play an important role in understanding whether self-control will be instantiated or not (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"These data strongly suggest that basic processes related to cognitive control (e.g., working memory, reliant on the dlPFC: Goldberg, 2001) overlap considerably with those involved in self-control of a more molar social type (e.g., suppressing one's emotional displays).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"In sum, there appears to be a close potential link between lower levels of task-motivation and self-control failures.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"The latter result is particularly important because numerous studies have now shown that being mindful of present reality (i.e., monitoring it to a greater extent) mitigates even clinical tendencies toward depression (Williams, 2008).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"Compton et al. (2008) found that individuals displaying stronger ERN responses to errors (reflecting error-monitoring processes: Holroyd \u0026 Coles, 2002) were better able to control their emotional reactions to stressors in daily life.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ndividuals displaying stronger ERNs had higher GPAs, a classic measure of self-control success (Tangney, Baumeister, \u0026 Boone, 2004).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"the monitoring processes linked to the ACC (\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"They found that a self-control depletion manipulation resulted in a smaller subsequent ERN signal in a basic cognitive task. Conceptually similar results have been reported by others (Inzlicht, McKay, \u0026 Aronson, 2006; Richeson \u0026 Shelton, 2003).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, task monitoring is sensitive to both depletion and motivational influences and may thus be a key component of whether self-control performance will be successful or not.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Finally, there is a great deal of convergence on the importance of the ACC (the generator of the ERN: van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2002) to monitoring both unwanted cognitive and social outcomes. It is well-established that the ACC responds to error-prone contexts or actual errors (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006). More recently, it has been shown that the ACC responds to social rejection manipulations (Eisenberger, Lieberman, \u0026 Williams, 2003), pain (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier, \u0026 Bushnell, 1997), and negative emotional events and experiences (Duncan \u0026 Barrett, 2007). Data of this type have led to the idea that the ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Results of this type are further suggestive that the same ACC-dlPFC circuit is likely to be involved in both cognitive control and self-control (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, the role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor, which in turn recruits the dlPFC to do the actual work of inhibiting problematic response tendencies (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"The first source establishes quite clearly that damage to the dlPFC results in problems in controlling habitual thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, if there is a brain locus of self-control, it is most clearly dependent on processes instantiated by the dlPFC (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"In this cognitive control context, the five studies of Robinson (2007) are informative. He found that individuals who paused following their cognitive errors to a greater extent reported (1) higher levels of life satisfaction, (2) lower levels of depression, (3) were seen to be happier by naı ̈ve observers, (4) were better capable of recognizing rewards and punishments in the environment, and (5) exhibited better abilities to inhibit dominant task sets.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Moeller and Robinson (2009) found that men, relative to women, exhibited this tendency to a lesser extent, consistent with men's greater levels of behavioral impulsivity (e.g., Eagly \u0026 Steffen, 1986).\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"Thus, a cognitive control model of self-control strength appears to have considerable value,\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"For the ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005), it should remain quiescent much of the time. Otherwise, it would lose its value, much like in the 'boy who cried wolf' parable.\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"What Baumeister and Vohs additionally suggested was that people are motivated to preserve their self-control resources for possible future use. Thus, there may be an inverse relation between task motivation and motivation to preserve one's self-control resources.\" (Robinson et al 2010:196)\n\n\"A further question should be considered - namely, whether self-control strength can be viewed in motivational rather than capacity-related terms, a possibility hinted at by some sources of data (Moller et al., 2006; Muraven \u0026 Slessareva, 2003). Regardless, further work concerned with this motivational-capacity interface seems desirable in better understanding it.\" (Robinson et al 2010:197)\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- published:: 2010\n\t- read:: 2015-03-07\n\n---","snippets":["*Abstract*: Self‐control strength is a central construct to theories of willpower, optimal functioning, freedom from addiction, and abilities to override problematic social motives and behaviors (e.g., aggression).

Understanding the processing basis of self‐control strength, and more particularly its depletion, is thus of paramount importance to both basic and applied literatures. Self‐control strength, the present review suggests, can be profitably viewed in cognitive control terms, particularly so in relation to operations of a brain‐based cognitive control circuit involving the anterior cingulate cortex (linked to monitoring potential or actual unwanted outcomes) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (linked to controlling potential or actual unwanted outcomes). Also, sufficient task motivation is important to operations of this circuit and depletion effects might be understood in terms of such depletion effects on task motivation. Multiple sources of evidence are marshaled in support of this cognitive control perspective of self‐control strength. It is concluded that viewing self‐control strength in cognitive control terms has considerable merit. Social, cognitive, personality, and clinical sources of data are integrated in the analysis.\n\t- why: \n\n#### Extracted Annotations (3/7/2015, 4:26:55 PM)\n\n\"William James (1890) was among the first psychologists to highlight the importance of self-control to adaptive functioning.\" (Robinson et al 2010:189)\n\n\"The self-control and cognitive control literatures, thus, would seem to overlap considerably in their mutual concern with the person's ability to inhibit dominant responses in a task-defined or otherwise strategic manner (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001; van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"In neurocognitive terms, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in monitoring problematic processing and behavioral occurrences (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006), whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in instantiating cognitive control in a goal-directed (rather than habitual) manner (Kerns et al., 2004; Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"we suggest that self-control is probably not special, but rather borrows from a general-purpose brain-based system related to concern with, monitoring of, and remediation of problematic events and behaviors of multiple types (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"An energizer of the cognitive control system is motivation (Sarter, Gehring, \u0026 Kozak, 2006). Stated in other terms, if there is low motivation to control a problematic tendency, it is unlikely that the cognitive control system of the prefrontal cortex will be recruited. This in turn would result in suboptimal performance (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Thus, one major component to self-control strength is likely one's willingness to work hard on a difficult task.\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Potentially separable from self-control capacity or even task motivation is what we term task monitoring. To perform non-habitual tasks well, potential or actual mistakes must be recognized. In the absence of recognizing error-proneness, cognitive and behavioral habits would dominate (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005)\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Although many of these habits would generally serve the self, many would not (Bargh \u0026 Chartrand, 1999).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192) ^309fcc\n\n\"The success (versus failure) of cognitive control is primarily a result of dlPFC activation (Kerns et al., 2004) and the processes uniquely implemented by this brain structure (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Note that these consequences of dlPFC damage are highly consistent with impaired self-control as highlighted by the strength-based theory of self-control (Baumeister et al., 2000). Thus, it is suggested that the recruitment of the dlPFC's resources should play an important role in understanding whether self-control will be instantiated or not (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"These data strongly suggest that basic processes related to cognitive control (e.g., working memory, reliant on the dlPFC: Goldberg, 2001) overlap considerably with those involved in self-control of a more molar social type (e.g., suppressing one's emotional displays).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"In sum, there appears to be a close potential link between lower levels of task-motivation and self-control failures.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"The latter result is particularly important because numerous studies have now shown that being mindful of present reality (i.e., monitoring it to a greater extent) mitigates even clinical tendencies toward depression (Williams, 2008).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"Compton et al. (2008) found that individuals displaying stronger ERN responses to errors (reflecting error-monitoring processes: Holroyd \u0026 Coles, 2002) were better able to control their emotional reactions to stressors in daily life.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ndividuals displaying stronger ERNs had higher GPAs, a classic measure of self-control success (Tangney, Baumeister, \u0026 Boone, 2004).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"the monitoring processes linked to the ACC (\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"They found that a self-control depletion manipulation resulted in a smaller subsequent ERN signal in a basic cognitive task. Conceptually similar results have been reported by others (Inzlicht, McKay, \u0026 Aronson, 2006; Richeson \u0026 Shelton, 2003).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, task monitoring is sensitive to both depletion and motivational influences and may thus be a key component of whether self-control performance will be successful or not.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Finally, there is a great deal of convergence on the importance of the ACC (the generator of the ERN: van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2002) to monitoring both unwanted cognitive and social outcomes. It is well-established that the ACC responds to error-prone contexts or actual errors (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006). More recently, it has been shown that the ACC responds to social rejection manipulations (Eisenberger, Lieberman, \u0026 Williams, 2003), pain (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier, \u0026 Bushnell, 1997), and negative emotional events and experiences (Duncan \u0026 Barrett, 2007). Data of this type have led to the idea that the ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Results of this type are further suggestive that the same ACC-dlPFC circuit is likely to be involved in both cognitive control and self-control (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, the role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor, which in turn recruits the dlPFC to do the actual work of inhibiting problematic response tendencies (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"The first source establishes quite clearly that damage to the dlPFC results in problems in controlling habitual thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, if there is a brain locus of self-control, it is most clearly dependent on processes instantiated by the dlPFC (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"In this cognitive control context, the five studies of Robinson (2007) are informative. He found that individuals who paused following their cognitive errors to a greater extent reported (1) higher levels of life satisfaction, (2) lower levels of depression, (3) were seen to be happier by naı ̈ve observers, (4) were better capable of recognizing rewards and punishments in the environment, and (5) exhibited better abilities to inhibit dominant task sets.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Moeller and Robinson (2009) found that men, relative to women, exhibited this tendency to a lesser extent, consistent with men's greater levels of behavioral impulsivity (e.g., Eagly \u0026 Steffen, 1986).\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"Thus, a cognitive control model of self-control strength appears to have considerable value,\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"For the ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005), it should remain quiescent much of the time. Otherwise, it would lose its value, much like in the 'boy who cried wolf' parable.\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"What Baumeister and Vohs additionally suggested was that people are motivated to preserve their self-control resources for possible future use. Thus, there may be an inverse relation between task motivation and motivation to preserve one's self-control resources.\" (Robinson et al 2010:196)\n\n\"A further question should be considered - namely, whether self-control strength can be viewed in motivational rather than capacity-related terms, a possibility hinted at by some sources of data (Moller et al., 2006; Muraven \u0026 Slessareva, 2003). Regardless, further work concerned with this motivational-capacity interface seems desirable in better understanding it.\" (Robinson et al 2010:197)\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- published:: 2010\n\t- read:: 2015-03-07\n\n---","wordCount":1429,"tags":[],"metadata":{"encountered":2015,"in":["[[Papers]]","[[Sources]]"],"people":["Michael D.

The Earth is at 0, and M is the centre of the large (deferent) circle. C is a point on the deferent circle, and is itself the centre of the epicycle on which travels the planet P. E is a point (the equant point) on the line OM (extended), such that OM=ME. C moves around on the deferent circle with a variable angular velocity, such that, viewed from the equant point E, it appears to be travelling uniformly. P moves on the epicycle in such a way that CP is always parallel to the line from O to the 'mean Sun' (reflecting the fact that the Earth-based observer is in reality in motion around the Sun). The ratio of the radii of the circles, the 'eccentrity' OM, and the two angular velocities, are then chosen to fit the motion of the particular planet.\n\n---\ndebate in the universities of the medieval West. It would be difficult enough for university students of Arts to reconcile eccentres and epicycles with what they were taught in their natural philosophy about the uniform motions of the Aristotelian concentric spheres; to reconcile the equant was quite impossible. \n\nFor this very reason, Copernicus in the sixteenth century would see it as a matter for self-congratulation, that his models needed no equants. \n\nIn the Almagest, Ptolemy provided geometric models that would, with fair accuracy, predict the motions of every one of the seven wanderers. He showed how the all-important parameters in his models could be derived from observations, though his general strategy was to work in the opposite direction: to present the models and then to 'test' them by comparing deductions from them against observations. With the help of the Almagest, mathematical astronomers (and astrologers) would be able to calculate tables of the positions of a planet in longitude and latitude for the indefinite future. \n\nThere were of course problems. He had found that the model for the Moon as adapted from Hipparchus represented well enough positions of the planet when Earth, Sun and Moon were in a straight line -unsurprisingly, in view of the use Hipparchus had made of Babylonian eclipse\n`p44`\nrecords in deriving his model but was unsatisfactory elsewhere. To remedy the defect, and so account for the Moon's irregularity that later became known as 'evection', he introduced a 'crank' mechanism that varied the distance from Earth of the Moon's epicycle. When Earth, Sun and Moon were aligned, the crank was fully extended and its presence made no difference; but elsewhere the crank pulled in the epicycle towards the Earth, most of all when the angle Sun-Earth-Moon was a right angle. The resulting model was satisfactory as far as computing lunar positions was concerned, but it implied that the height of the Moon above the Earth varied between 33 and 64 Earth radii. This ought to have resulted in its apparent diameter varying by a factor of nearly two; yet such variations were not in fact observed in the real Moon. How much this bothered Ptolemy's readers depended on whether they were looking for something more than accurate tables of position. \n\nAnother problem stemmed from a curious fact of observation. Two of the lesser planets -Mercury and Venus are never to be seen far from the Sun: they rise and set with the Sun, unlike Mars, Jupiter and Saturn which may be seen in the sky at any time of night. Ptolemy replicated this in his models for Venus and Mercury by aligning the centres of their epicycles with the 'mean Sun', sO that all three had the same period of one year. Some of his readers, however, were unhappy with such an ad hoc device. \n\nBut these were details. Ptolemy's Almagest achieved what it set out to do: to provide a set of geometrical models for calculating accurate tables of the future positions in the sky of each of the seven planets. It marked the culmination of centuries of effort.\n\nPtolemy made no attempt in the Almagest to present an integrated 'Ptolemaic System' of the heavens, but he did permit himself a few sentences on the order of the planets, in terms of their respective heights above the central Earth. It seemed plausible to make the fixed stars the outermost (as indeed Eudoxus and Aristotle had assumed half millennium before), and to place nearest to these stars those planets whose motions most closely imitated the motion of the stars. On this basis Saturn -whose motion differed from that of the stars by only one circuit every thirty years -was the highest of the planets, with Jupiter (one in twelve years) and Mars (one in two years) next.

Let's cultivate this inherently rich endeavor.\n\nMy first stop for thinking is to the [[Relate]] where I do what's easy. That means bouncing from note to note, developing them in a special way to maintain [[Flow]]. I keep the [[Concepts]] handy because I believe a handful of core concepts influence our entire worldview in disproportionately powerful ways. These notes help me make leaps of insights while connecting new ideas to existing concepts.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]- Some links and content in this note have been removed.\n\u003e Because this is a vertical slice of my actual PKM system, I can't include everything in this vault and I left out some notes and material for ease of navigation and understanding the concepts (rather than getting lost in the knowledge) as well as for privacy.\n\u003e\n\u003e Plus, it's okay to have some unlinked notes in your own vault. They won't all be built out at once.\n\nI'm a big believing in the power of prompts. A couple good prompts is enough to kickstart my thinking. That's why I have so many notes on prompts such as \"The NoMa Method\", the \"7 C's\", and even the \"11 C's\". But for Ideaverse Lite, I'll just point you towards [[Refraction Thinking]] and [[Levels of Magnification]].\n\nIf you want to solve a problem _and_ gain clarity, a nice concept to brush up on is the [[OODA Loop]].\n\nOutside the scope of Ideaverse Lite are my joyful suite of mind exercises. I love jumping into the gauntlet of [[Thought Unpacking]] and [[Thought Enriching]]—both of which generate large quantities of [[Thought Collisions]]. The \"unpacking\" is best to prompt critical and analytical thinking. The \"enriching\" is best to exercise the lateral, creative, and metaphorical muscles of the mind.\n\nWant more mind training?\n\n- Go to [[Meditation Jaunts]] and [[Brief Meditation Sequences]] to slow down and reset.\n- Go to a few of your [[Mind Palaces]] to work your visualizing muscles.\n- Combine the mental with the physical for the world-champion [[Lucia Stance]]\n- A few grounding tactics are to brush up the [[FlowCreation MOC]] and [[Habits Map]]s.\n\nAlways remember, one of the best prompting tools out there is the thesaurus. So when you want to both jumpstart and enrich your thinking, grab a thesaurus and go on a [[Word Excursion]].\n\n## Definitions\n\nLet's define some overlapping conceptual categories:\n\n- **Concept**: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.\n- **Mental Models** are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms that—_when applied to a current situation or thing_—allow for efficient, optimal action.

They are the purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes. This is the core method of growing a healthy, dynamic zettelkasten.\n\nDespite the proclamations, direct links alone are not enough. They do not allow for easy, dependable high-level navigation. They are a system of streets connecting one block to another. But sometimes you want to zoom out and view the map.\n\n### Folders\nFolders are rigid and exclusionary by their nature. Whatever is in a folder lives separated from the main collection. It’s a rigid hierarchy that imposes order. Without special workarounds this limits note accessibility, discourages interdisciplinary thinking, and stunts the long-term growth of a complex and interesting Zettelkasten.\n\nThere are some strategic uses for folders, but their overuse may be a sign that the user is uncomfortable with other, arguably better methods of building relationships between notes while maintaining the long-term health of their digital library. If you have some quixotic notion about creating a digital library that acts as an interesting conversation partner — folders don’t make it as easy.\n\nWhat about for projects? Depending on the use cases, a person might like using folders for projects.\n\n*   If your goal is to manage projects, folders are great — maybe even ideal. You might decide that you want your projects to be actively walled-off units.\n*   But once they are final, you would need to take the extra steps of reformulating any good stuff into your main digital library.\n\nA possible use for a folder is as a temporary inbox, or “incubation” folder. As long as you view these research streams as temporary staging grounds, to be deleted or assimilated with the Borg- er, I mean, your main-brain-frame; you should be fine. Otherwise, that inbox folder can get awfully crufty.\n\nAnother possible use for folders would be for “very clearly defined” notes. For example, things like: Images, People, Quotes, and Source Materials (things written by other people). You don’t have to use these folders; you could easily add their contents into the main vault; but you might find it keeps things slightly more tidy.\n\nBut know this: retreating too much into project-based folder management will cripple your long-term thinking partner (i.e., your zettelkasten) from growing complex, dynamic, and interesting cross-genre connections. You won’t have a zettelkasten, you’ll have a collection of silo-ed folders. Those are massive costs to consider.\n\nThat said, limiting accessibility may be ideal for private information like finances, health, and private journaling. Then a folder is the perfect instrumental to intentionally cordon off those notes from the rest.\n\n### Tags\nTags are relatively weak associations, but don’t discount them. They are easy ways to quickly filter large swathes of notes. Tags are more fluid: one note can have multiple tags. The problem is that _tags alone don’t scale_.\n\nSay you have a `#PermanentNote` tag or tag page. Whenever you take notes on something you read or watch, you apply that tag. It’s great when only 50 notes have that tag. It’s far less useful when 500 notes have that tag.\n\n#### Multiple Tags\nA partial solution is to use multiple tags, so you can search for: `#PermanentNote` `#habit` to filter in only those results.\n\n\u003e But the problem here is that you have to remember each tag!\n\nWhat happens when you can’t remember that when you’re tagging a new note? You end up using `#improvement` or something else. Sure, maybe you can remember this single `#habit` example. But over time you’ll lose track of how to tag a new note in a way you can reliably retrieve (meaning that it will scale well and you’ll remember it). By the way, software that allows for “starred” notes is just exercising a form of tagging.\n\n#### Tags with Saved Boolean Search\nSaved Searches are another partial and robust solution. You can save a tag search like `#PermanentNote` AND `#habit`.\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/764/1*uCSHtOqZCE3izP1-l_6RUQ.png)\n\n#### Using Tags for Chronological Searches\nTags also work well in the temporal context. Here are some tags that work well as a search when your notes have timestamps:  `#journal | #writing ; #people | #waiting | #x/log/meeting ; #health | #workout ; and even #source`\n\n### Proximity\nEveryone tends to forget how we use the proximity between notes to build relationships. Organizing by proximity can be weak and arbitrary (airplane flight sitting next to total strangers) or strong and meaningful (airplane flight next to your family). It just depends on what level you apply it. There are 3 basic levels of proximity.\n\n1.  **Organizing by Proximity in the main folder:**\n\n*   _Alphabetical_: Sure “Apple” and “Banana” start next to each other and hold a strong relationship. But over time that proximity will change; because years later the list looks like “Apple”, “aqua”, “aqualung”, “arabesque”, “arachne”, “arbiter”, “arc”, “arena”, “aries”, “arise”, “Arkansas”, “Banana”. So relationships that start out strong can weaken over time.\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/586/1*uzcKVhnrPyQ6bNNwEuCP6Q.png)\n\n*   _Chronological:_ If you sort by creation date, the proximities between notes won’t change but they are inherently more arbitrary (random), except for their temporal context (which holds varying value depending on the context).\n\n**2\\. Organizing by Proximity in the same subfolder:**\n\n*   Notes in the same subfolder will have a closer relationship since they are grouped in the same vicinity. But this comes at the cost of being silo-ed from the rest of the note library.\n\n**3\\. Organizing by Proximity in an MOC (Map of Content):**\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/930/1*_2jKjcURnsgnTmDCZWspuA.png)\n\n*   Notes in the same MOC are very likely to be closely related, especially after they are manually sorted in some form of relational positioning. This is the best way to apply the power of proximity.\n\nUsing just a single note, you can identify and build relationships between notes.\n\n### Map of Contents (MOC)\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2856/1*-zaTKc2p6Bv_lGR7DCwHmQ.png)\n\nAn MOC is just a note — a very special type of note. It uses proximity effectively and acts like a tag and a non-exclusive folder at the same time.\n\n*   Tag-like: It groups the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)\n*   Folder-like: It assembles notes in a tightly-packed grouping.\n*   Proximity: It grants you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.\n\n\u003e In this way, MOCs don’t limit access, they **curate** it — while keeping your notes free.\n\nUsing MOCs is like being in your own warehouse full of workbenches, where each workbench contains a selection of highly curated index cards for you to engage with.\n\nAnother way to consider MOCs is through emergence.\n\n\u003e MOCs are Evergreen notes, just at the next level of emergence.\n\nIn an MOC, the party is always happening. It’s the “room where it happens.” Individual notes can “shadow-clone” themselves and essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous — interacting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!\n\n_Q: How do MOCs compare to TOCs (Table of Contents)?_\n\nA: Whereas MOCs are fluid, TOCs are rigid. This is by design. A table of contents is for assembling a specific and linear order. MOCs serve much broader purposes. Oftentimes an MOC can morph into a TOC as a project starts to finalize.\n\n### A Home Note\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2418/1*XDjhBzNev_j-6EnXRFoc3Q.png)\n\nThink of your Home note as the highest-level of your zettelkasten / digital library. It has links to the main MOCs in your library along with your most relevant tags.\n\nIt is an excellent access point because it encourages you to focus on the areas in your life that you’ve deemed as important.\n\nA Home note creates stronger, longer-lasting connections, especially as one’s library grows far beyond 1000 notes.\n\n### Don’t fall for the dogma\nUntil recently, folders were all we had. They weren’t good enough. Now we have links. Now many people have taken a hard stance that all they need are links. Hard stances become fragile stances. Don’t fall for the dogma. The right tools for a healthy digital library include a multitude of relationship-builders.\n\nThese relationship-builders include: a Home note. Maps of Content. Direct Links. Proximity. Tags.\n\nAnd yes, even a few folders.","snippets":["![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1408/1*SMU0M-iBKedBR6PwUKrayw.png)"],"rawContent":"---\nup:\n  - \"[[Ideaverse Map]]\"\nrelated: []\ncreated: 2020-08-08\npublished: 2020-08-08\ntags:\n  - output/article☑️\nURLs:\n  - https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6\n---\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] This is the 2nd best version.

Are you confused about when to use a **folder** versus a **tag** versus a **link** versus a **Map of Content**? Let’s explore each “relationship-builder” and how we can use them expertly.\n\n_Main Ideas_\n\n*   Top-down categorizing has gotten a bad rap. It has a place.\n*   Bottom-up creating is great, but it needs a bit of top-down structure as your library grows. But using just folders is the WRONG way.\n*   **Maps of Contents (MOCs)** are game-changers.\n\nA flat structure of notes — i.e. one big folder — is “frictionless”. There is no thinking “now where exactly does this go?” However, over time it becomes messy and overwhelming. To overcome the chaos, we need to build healthy, flexible frameworks that can grow with our knowledge over time.\n\nLet’s examine the known— and lesser known — ways we form useful relationships between notes.\n\n### Direct Links\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1408/1*SMU0M-iBKedBR6PwUKrayw.png)\n\nDirect links are the strongest type of relationship.

How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?\n2. \"I'm Anxious, my mind is scattered.\" What's my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?\n3. \"I'm not excited about anything, I'm apathetic.\" I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?\n4. \"I'm tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much.\" Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?\n\n## Four Factors of Flow\n\nI have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially [[Four Factors of Flow]]. They are: [[Direction (re Flow)]], [[Attention (re Flow)]], [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]], and [[Energy (re Flow)]]. The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you're lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area.\n","wordCount":410,"tags":[],"metadata":{"created":"2020-06-01","related":["[[Conditions of Flow]]"],"up":["[[FlowCreation MOC]]"]},"created":"2025-05-22T16:13:18.896984158Z","modified":"2025-01-03T20:44:44Z","checksum":"9b679e9d92b7d1f4bb2c346b4cae9c55dcf2a6c5d808d8ef0aa075d6778791d6"},{"filename":"Chunking.md","filenameStem":"Chunking","path":"Atlas/Dots/Things/Chunking.md","absPath":"/home/tjex/thesis/ideaverse-lite-1.5/Atlas/Dots/Things/Chunking.md","title":"George A.

It works incredibly well in Obsidian and in your computer's file folder system as well. \n\t- It's a release valve, an easy way to tuck away those \"extra\" types of notes, such as \"notes about notes\" (meta notes, vault-related notes), utility notes, archived notes, and less immediately relevant \"placeholder folders\" that, while not overly important now, still serve you as a tucked away reminder of a topic or area of simmering or potential interest. \n\t- Keen observers with notice that some folders have been shuffled around as a result.\n- Installed the highly customized Soft Paper Theme.\n    - This alternative to the default Prism theme will put you in a calmer and more reflective state of mind.\n- Updated `Atlas` folder structures and organization\n\t- Renamed `Atlas/Notes` folder to `Atlas/Dots` folder\n\t\t- Renamed `Atlas/Dots/Ideas` folder to `Atlas/Dots/Things` folder\n\t\t- Created a new folder `Atlas/Dots/Statements` and moved all statements there\n\t\t- This is to reflect how [[Evergreen notes are things or statements about things]]\n- **Metadata power shift** from tags ➡️ properties to organize notes and collections\n\t- Notes that had a `type` property for the subtype it was (ex. for sources notes there was `type: Book`) were instead converted into the `in` property and a link to the related note (ex. `[[Books]]`).\n\t- `#concept` tag replaced with `in` property to `[[Concepts]]`.\n\t- Notes with subtags like `#map/view` were replaced by the `in` property with links to both `[[Maps]]` and `[[Views]]`.\n\t\t- This was also the case for source notes like `#source/article`, which were turned into the links to notes `[[Sources]]` and `[[Articles]]`\n\t\t- For an example on this, you can visit [[The Almagest]]\n\t- Instead of Dataview queries using tags to search for notes, the new main filter criteria is through a note's `in` property.\n- Quickly and powerfully find your most important notes by using the new [[Maps]] and [[Views]] collection notes\n- Updated [[Ideaverse Map]]\n\t- Added mention of other folders beyond ACE in \"How to customize your ACE headspace\"\n\t- Added new callout under \"Extra gifts\" for acknowledging the intentional usage of styles in the Ideaverse\n- Simplified the [[Library]] note's formatting.\n\t- By taking the text out of the callouts, we are encouraging you to actually edit the Library note to make it your own.\n## Minor changes\n- Removed `Excalibrain` community plugin due to unexpected behavior on initial load\n- Embedded LYT YouTube videos into relevant notes for further learning\n- Replaced all previous mentions of \"Ideaverse for Obsidian\" with \"Ideaverse Lite\" to avoid confusion with [[Ideaverse Pro]]\n- Fixed unrequited notes callouts to still work even if the file name changes\n## New Notes in this Version\n```dataview\nlist\nfrom \"\"\nwhere contains(version, \"1.5\")\nsort file.name\n```\n## Major Note Updates\n```dataview\nTABLE updates as \"Updates\"\nFROM \"\"\nWHERE updates\nsort file.name\n```\n\n\n---\n\n# Ideaverse Lite 1.0 - Release Notes\n*Released 2023-08-30*\n**Headlines**\n- Introduced the [[Home]] note with ACE head spaces.\n\t- Provide multiple examples of \n\t- Provided a basic ARC Framework (Add, Relate, Communicate) for developing ideas into outputs.\n- Introduced the [[ACE Folder Framework]].\n\t- Provided ACE with multiple notes and examples.\n- Introduced a working system for [[Efforts]] based on intensities. \n\t- Provided \"Efforts\" with multiple examples.\n\n**Details**\n- 310 notes \n- Improved several data views to power up your navigating experience.\n- Did general clean-up. \n- Changed the name of the kit from LYT Kit to Ideaverse Lite because Ideaverse evokes the connected, yet wide open nature of notes and ideas.\n\t- Further, this release is called Ideaverse Lite. But the name opens the door for other versions such as of Ideaverse for Organizations and Ideaverse for XYZ. So the name change allows the principles to naturally transcend the tool. \n\n\n---\n\n# LYT Kit 7 - Release Notes\n*Released 2022-09-13*\n\n**Headlines**\n- Vintage Home note\n- 16 empowered maps in the Home note\n- ACCESS folders streamlined to 10 folders\n- Introducing \"Efforts\"\n\n**Details**\n- 286 notes \n- Vintage Home note. \n\t- Remade the Home note to match the original version that brought me so much joy.\n- 16 empowered maps in the Home note.

In May 2020, I shared the first version of something that is now known as Ideaverse Lite.\n\nWhen I first shared my thoughts on \"LYT frameworks\" and \"maps of content\", I was full of doubt. \"Am I just creating idiosyncratic nonsense?\"\n\nI still remember the private Discord chat I had with Steen Comer (aka Mediapathic). He validated my ideas. I greatly respected his opinion (still do), and his support strengthened my enthusiasm to keep sharing. (Sometimes the tiniest amount of validation makes a giant difference.)\n\nThe rest, I suppose, is history. Since then, I have ran six workshops on \"Linking Your Thinking\" with 500 people over the past 1.5 years. There are plenty of numbers I could share with you, but that feels a bit tacky. I would rather share my feelings about the people I've met.\n\nAbove I asked, \"What changed?\"\n\nWhat changed was knowing that I'm not alone.\n\n**What changed was meeting you.**\n\nYou validated my thoughts, even when you challenged them—_especially_ when you challenged them.\n\nYou shared insights and perspectives that enriched my own—and the resulting dialogue enriched us all.\n\nTogether, we have become more than the sum of our parts.\n\nWe have broken free from the treadmill of constant \"note-taking\".\nWe have reclaimed our agency to be in control of our thinking processes.\n\nWe are the Note Makers...\n\n...fighting against the forces that would have us mindlessly consume their content.\n\n...perhaps even fighting for the soul of thinking.\n\nWe know in our bones that thinking is inherently valuable—not just a way to \"get more things done\".\n\nWe know that wrestling with ideas is far more valuable than being fed them.\n\nThe Note Maker knows deep down that it's not the destination that matters, but the journey.\n\nThe Note Maker knows that the answer to the riddle...\n\n...is in fact\n\n...the riddle itself.\n\nMeeting you has forever changed my life.\n\nI am grateful for the riddles we have wrestled together in 2021.\n\nAnd I can't wait for the riddles we will uncover in 2022.\n\n---\n\n## Here's a recap of things I've shared in the past 1.5 years\n\nLooking back on the past year and a half, a lot has happened.\n\nRegardless of when you joined, here's a recap of some notable things I've contributed to the dialogues around PKM and the how and why of making meaningful notes.\n\nMay 2020\n\n- Shared the first version of the **LYT Kit**.\n- Introduced and defined the term \"**Maps of Content**\" and \"**MOC**\" (pronounced (EM-OH-SEE) for _digital_ knowledge management. While an MOC can function as a boring index, it is actually an entirely new thinking tool that can take our ideation to the next level.\n- Introduced and defined the term **Fluid Frameworks** in the context of knowledge management: \"Any adaptable framework, or structure, that helps but doesn't hinder note retrieval and/or idea management.\"\n- Created and shared the Obsidian theme **Cybertron**.\n\nJuly 2020\n\n- Led the first **LYT Workshop** to a private group of volunteers.\n- During that workshop, I formally created and introduced the theory of \"**Idea Emergence**\", which I believe is one of the most important contributions I've made to the space of knowledge management. Later, I publicly shared an overview of it on Twitter. [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1317190776284086272)\n- Created and introduced the terms \"**Mental Squeeze Point**\" and \"**Middle-out Thinking**\".\n- Coined the phrase, \"**Age of the Linked Note**\". Later, I publicly shared it on Twitter. [note](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1344034466633666560?s=20)\n\nAugust 2020\n\n- Formally made the argument against \"Progressive Summarization\". Aside from being poorly named, it takes well-intentioned minds and drills habits that weakens your ability to think.\n- In that article, I sharpened and defined the differences between \"Note-taking\" and \"**Note-making**\". It is not just semantics. It is a distinction with serious consequences.\n\nOctober 2020\n\n- Publicly predicted that Obsidian would overtake Roam Research.

It is just as true this year:\n\nI would have never imagined having such wonderful conversations with poets and novelists, programmers and worldbuilders, students and educators, physicists and psychologists, autodidacts and coronavirus researchers, genetic counselors and innovative marketers, former firefighters and current fathers, game developers and IT folks, data quality controllers and social history academics, librarians and designers...\n\n      ...and that was just in Workshop 2!!\n\nNot only am I inspired and enriched by our time together, but it has made the pandemic feel far less lonely. This is a year that has made people feel unbearably lonely. But for many of us, we found each other. It's not everything, but I know it's eased the burden of loneliness for me.\n\nIt's made me realize that when it comes to a love and appreciation of ideas and writing and \"sense-making\"...there are many more of us than I imagined 1.5 years ago. We are not alone!\n\nNow we get to leave 2021 having found others like us: curious, thoughtful, analytical yet creative, like-minded yet diverse in perspective, good-spirited, kind-hearted, willing to learn and willing to share.\n\nIn another upside down sort of year, it's been the best of times, it's been the worst of times.\n\n\u003e Just like the last two years of the pandemic, we are complex, multi-faceted, perplexing, and fascinating.\n\nAnd I'm beyond grateful to have crossed paths with you.\n\nHere's hoping for healthy 2022—and for us to continue the great conversation!\n\n## Theme Review + Theme for 2022\n\nFor 2021, I wanted it to be the \"Year of the Note Maker\".\n\nThat's because I love wrestling with ideas and developing them over time. I love making leaps of insights between them and building massive value while having so much joy in the process. Note-making is a way to super-charge our thinking in the age of the linked note.\n\nLooking back on the avalanche of joyful and stimulating thoughts throughout the entire year...thoughts that talked to each other...thoughts that evolved...many of which grew into things I shared in live events, videos, articles, and conversations...I actually feel a bit guilty. 2021 was almost too good!\n\nBut the best is yet to come. That's why a sequel has been green-lit.\n\nFor 2022, my theme will be: \"Return of the Note Maker\".\n\nThat means more note-making for me—because I believe note-making creates a growing forest of evergreen value; and even if that value is not directly related to any specific goal, it creates an inescapably large surface area of luck. It creates options. ^869aae\n\nNote-making pulls double-duty: it enriches your life while also making you more valuable in many of the jobs, careers, and endeavors you might encounter.\n\nWhat about for you?\n\n**_Can you give yourself a theme for the year?_**\n\nHappy (early) New Year, and as always, Stay Connected!\n\nNick\n\nPS: This isn't the official launch, but as promised, before the end of the year, for the next two days, you can enroll early into LYT Workshop 7 and lock in the current price. You have until midnight December 30th anywhere on Earth.\n\nPPS: What's the #1 PKM problem you want to solve in 2022? How can I help? Feel free to email me back. I'll do my best to response.\n\n## Random\n\nOld book idea \"we just don't think enough\"\nnew years 2018-19?? waterfall walk?\n\nLYT Kit\nLYT Notes Newsletter - 2021-02-21\nFlight School\n\n## Favorite Youtube \u0026 tweet shares\n\n- Oct 14, 2020 - Why Obsidian Will Overtake Roam\n- we have entered the age of the linked [note](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1344034466633666560?s=20)\n- Idea Emergence - [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1317190776284086272)\n- what is a note\n- plugins\n- Note wars - [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1349771007897178112)\n- how to outline fast\n- 2021-02-28 - Timelapse\n- Rogets thesaurus - [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1368618816758894592?s=20)\n- 2021-03-30 - [Focused Podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused/122)\n- PKM planet\n- what gets me fired [up](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1403800587406221312?s=20)\n- Love letter\n- Think better with graph view\n- Sensemaking 101\n- [The gist of MOCs on twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1445396611866181637?s=20)\n- 2021-12-09 - Sensemaking workshop with Mike Schmitz","snippets":["Three years ago I was working on Breaking Bad the movie."],"rawContent":"---\nup:\n  - \"[[🗞️ Newsletter (OE) (Example)]]\"\ncreated: 2021-12-28\ntags:\n  - output/newsletter\n---\n\n# LYT Notes 30 - Reflecting on 2021\n\nThree years ago I was working on Breaking Bad the movie.\n\nMy career in editing was taking off.\n\nThree months ago, I was working on the final season of Better Call Saul.\n\nThis time, my career in editing was coming to a close.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nThis.\n\nNothing has felt more organic than this.\n\nAlong with editing (and other endeavors), I have always loved to think.\n\nI have found that nerdy thinkers have a passion for note-taking apps.\n\nEven nerdier thinkers have a passion for _plain-text_ note-taking apps.\n\nThat's how I joined the Obsidian beta in April, 2020: as a nerdy thinker geeking out on finally having auto-updating links for plain-text files.\n\nIn those early and crazy days of Obsidian and the Pandemic, I listened, explored, and shared a lot in the chat and the forums. In May 2020, I shared the first version of something that is now known as Ideaverse Lite.\n\nWhen I first shared my thoughts on \"LYT frameworks\" and \"maps of content\", I was full of doubt. \"Am I just creating idiosyncratic nonsense?\"\n\nI still remember the private Discord chat I had with Steen Comer (aka Mediapathic). He validated my ideas. I greatly respected his opinion (still do), and his support strengthened my enthusiasm to keep sharing. (Sometimes the tiniest amount of validation makes a giant difference.)\n\nThe rest, I suppose, is history. Since then, I have ran six workshops on \"Linking Your Thinking\" with 500 people over the past 1.5 years. There are plenty of numbers I could share with you, but that feels a bit tacky. I would rather share my feelings about the people I've met.\n\nAbove I asked, \"What changed?\"\n\nWhat changed was knowing that I'm not alone.\n\n**What changed was meeting you.**\n\nYou validated my thoughts, even when you challenged them—_especially_ when you challenged them.\n\nYou shared insights and perspectives that enriched my own—and the resulting dialogue enriched us all.\n\nTogether, we have become more than the sum of our parts.\n\nWe have broken free from the treadmill of constant \"note-taking\".\nWe have reclaimed our agency to be in control of our thinking processes.\n\nWe are the Note Makers...\n\n...fighting against the forces that would have us mindlessly consume their content.\n\n...perhaps even fighting for the soul of thinking.\n\nWe know in our bones that thinking is inherently valuable—not just a way to \"get more things done\".\n\nWe know that wrestling with ideas is far more valuable than being fed them.\n\nThe Note Maker knows deep down that it's not the destination that matters, but the journey.\n\nThe Note Maker knows that the answer to the riddle...\n\n...is in fact\n\n...the riddle itself.\n\nMeeting you has forever changed my life.\n\nI am grateful for the riddles we have wrestled together in 2021.\n\nAnd I can't wait for the riddles we will uncover in 2022.\n\n---\n\n## Here's a recap of things I've shared in the past 1.5 years\n\nLooking back on the past year and a half, a lot has happened.\n\nRegardless of when you joined, here's a recap of some notable things I've contributed to the dialogues around PKM and the how and why of making meaningful notes.\n\nMay 2020\n\n- Shared the first version of the **LYT Kit**.\n- Introduced and defined the term \"**Maps of Content**\" and \"**MOC**\" (pronounced (EM-OH-SEE) for _digital_ knowledge management. While an MOC can function as a boring index, it is actually an entirely new thinking tool that can take our ideation to the next level.\n- Introduced and defined the term **Fluid Frameworks** in the context of knowledge management: \"Any adaptable framework, or structure, that helps but doesn't hinder note retrieval and/or idea management.\"\n- Created and shared the Obsidian theme **Cybertron**.\n\nJuly 2020\n\n- Led the first **LYT Workshop** to a private group of volunteers.\n- During that workshop, I formally created and introduced the theory of \"**Idea Emergence**\", which I believe is one of the most important contributions I've made to the space of knowledge management. Later, I publicly shared an overview of it on Twitter. [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1317190776284086272)\n- Created and introduced the terms \"**Mental Squeeze Point**\" and \"**Middle-out Thinking**\".\n- Coined the phrase, \"**Age of the Linked Note**\". Later, I publicly shared it on Twitter. [note](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1344034466633666560?s=20)\n\nAugust 2020\n\n- Formally made the argument against \"Progressive Summarization\". Aside from being poorly named, it takes well-intentioned minds and drills habits that weakens your ability to think.\n- In that article, I sharpened and defined the differences between \"Note-taking\" and \"**Note-making**\". It is not just semantics. It is a distinction with serious consequences.\n\nOctober 2020\n\n- Publicly predicted that Obsidian would overtake Roam Research. At the time, that was a very unpopular opinion. Not so much today.\n- Started LYT Workshop 2\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n- Shared my favorite but most underrated video essay \"**Note Wars**\".\n- Started LYT Workshop 3\n\nFebruary 2021\n\n- Started the **LYT Notes Newsletter**.\n- Shared a random but cool Obsidian Timelapse video set to epic music.\n\nMarch 2021\n\n- Shared a digital version of Roget's Thesaurus using Obsidian Publish (all thanks to Denis for this gift).\n- Joined the Focused Podcast with David Sparks and Mike Schmitz.

What a way to unearth hidden connections!\n\nStarting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], [[Levels of Magnification]], and [[Refraction Thinking]]. \n\nFor my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]]. \n\n\u003e [!Connect]- A single concept opens up new ways of looking at the world\n\u003e ![[McCall-pen-sketch-narrow.jpg]]\n\n[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Lindy Effect]], along with [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Cause and Effect]]. This reminds me of [[Concept Expansion]].\n\nIn times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Yin and Yang]], [[Synthesis]], [[Seasons]], and the [[Mountain Top Water Drop]]. Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]]. [[Aikido]] is good to remember. \n\nFor more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [[Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Munger's Mental Models]].\n\n---\n\nWant to more deeply understand the flexible power of MOCs?

Did they put you behind a device with hundreds of lenses to test your vision? \n\nThey call this device a \"phoropter\", but it's informally known as a \"refractor\". \n\nRefraction is \"the turning or bending of any wave, such as a light or sound wave, when it passes from one medium into another of different optical density.\"\n\nIt turns out that, as we think, we can apply to principles of refraction. **Refraction thinking** is *\"thinking about ONE thing, through the lens of ANOTHER thing.\"* \n\nApplying \"refraction\" to our thinking is why \"mental models\" are so effective: they allow us to see the world in a different way. \n\nThe term \"mental model\" grew to prominence as the great thinker Charlie Munger used to frequently in speeches as he implored others to see patterns, think holistically, and essentially...connect the dots. \n\nMunger and Warren Buffet were a formidable one-two punch in the financial industry. Hence, that term \"mental models\" is used excessively by the Wall Street financial types, which can make the word feel dirty to those outside of that hyper-aggressive world. It's no one's fault. But this is why severing the conflation between mental models and Wall Street is so important: using mental models is something we all do—and have done—long before the term was coined. \n\nWith this realization, I want you to see that ***mental models are nothing more than lenses through which we view stuff***. That means anything—any thought, or person, or time, or place, or idea—can be a lens for you. That's why I prefer a truer and simpler word for these \"concepts that enhance or compel our thinking\". \n\nConcepts. They are all just concepts. \n\nContinue the essay: [[Concepts are prisms that bend the light around any thought]].\n\n---\n\n## More\nSee [[Concepts]] for a bunch of excellent lenses to refract your thinking.

It's the system and process behind the goal. Achieving your goal only changes your life for a moment. We think the results need to change, but it's the process that needs to change.

Behaviors that are immediately punished don't get repeated. That's why you need to make it enjoyable in the moment. One way is tying your identity to it.

And I learned that “Shorty, can I see your bike?” was never a sincere question, and “Yo, you was messing with my cousin” was neither an earnest accusation nor a misunderstanding of the facts. These were the summonses that you answered with your left foot forward, your right foot back, your hands guarding your face, one slightly lower than the other, cocked like a hammer. Or they were answered by breaking out, ducking through alleys, cutting through backyards, then bounding through the door past your kid brother into your bedroom, pulling the tool out of your lambskin or from under your mattress or out of your Adidas shoebox, then calling up your own cousins (who really aren’t) and returning to that same block, on that same day, and to that same crew, hollering out, “Yeah, nigger, what’s up now?” I recall learning these laws clearer than I recall learning my colors and shapes, because these laws were essential to the security of my body.\n\n---\n\u003e A year after I watched the boy with the small eyes pull out a gun, my father beat me for letting another boy steal from me.

I was a capable boy, intelligent, well-liked, but powerfully afraid. And I felt, vaguely, wordlessly, that for a child to be marked off for such a life, to be forced to live in fear was a great injustice. And what was the source of this fear? What was hiding behind the smoke screen of streets and schools? And what did it mean that number 2 pencils, conjugations without context, Pythagorean theorems, handshakes, and head nods were the difference between life and death, were the curtains drawing down between the world and me?\n\n---\n\u003e I took a survey of Europe post-1800.

I remember the soft face of Alessandro de’ Medici, the royal bearing of Bosch’s black magi. These images, cast in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were contrasted with those created after enslavement, the Sambo caricatures I had always known. What was the difference? In my survey course of America, I’d seen portraits of the Irish drawn in the same ravenous, lustful, and simian way. Perhaps there had been other bodies, mocked, terrorized, and insecure. Perhaps the Irish too had once lost their bodies. Perhaps being named “black” had nothing to do with any of this; perhaps being named “black” was just someone’s name for being at the bottom, a human turned to object, object turned to pariah.\n\n---\n\u003e But not all of us. It must have been around that time that I discovered an essay by Ralph Wiley in which he responded to Bellow’s quip. “Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus,” wrote Wiley. “Unless you find a profit in fencing off universal properties of mankind into exclusive tribal ownership.” And there it was. I had accepted Bellow’s premise. In fact, Bellow was no closer to Tolstoy than I was to Nzinga. And if I were closer it would be because I chose to be, not because of destiny written in DNA. My great error was not that I had accepted someone else’s dream but that I had accepted the fact of dreams, the need for escape, and the invention of racecraft.\n\n---\n\u003e **She had never known her father,** which put her in the company of the greater number of everyone I’d known. I felt then that these men—these “fathers”—were the greatest of cowards. But I also felt that the galaxy was playing with loaded dice, which ensured an excess of cowards in our ranks. The girl from Chicago understood this too, and she understood something more—that all are not equally robbed of their bodies, that the bodies of women are set out for pillage in ways I could never truly know. And she was the kind of black girl who’d been told as a child that she had better be smart because her looks wouldn’t save her, and then told as a young woman that she was really pretty for a dark-skinned girl. And so there was, all about her, a knowledge of cosmic injustices, the same knowledge I’d glimpsed all those years ago watching my father reach for his belt, watching the suburban dispatches in my living room, watching the golden-haired boys with their toy trucks and football cards, and dimly perceiving the great barrier between the world and me.\n\n---\n\u003e **There was also wisdom in those streets.** I think now of the old rule that held that should a boy be set upon in someone else’s chancy hood, his friends must stand with him, and they must all take their beating together. I now know that within this edict lay the key to all living. None of us were promised to end the fight on our feet, fists raised to the sky. We could not control our enemies’ number, strength, nor weaponry. Sometimes you just caught a bad one. But whether you fought or ran, you did it together, because that is the part that was in our control. What we must never do is willingly hand over our own bodies or the bodies of our friends. That was the wisdom: We knew we did not lay down the direction of the street, but despite that, we could—and must—fashion the way of our walk. And that is the deeper meaning of your name—that the struggle, in and of itself, has meaning.\n\n---\n\u003e  I have raised you to respect every human being as singular\n\n---\n\u003e Never forget that we were enslaved in this country longer than we have been free. Never forget that for 250 years black people were born into chains—whole generations followed by more generations who knew nothing but chains.\n\n---\n\u003e So you must wake up every morning knowing that no promise is unbreakable, least of all the promise of waking up at all. This is not despair. These are the preferences of the universe itself: verbs over nouns, actions over states, struggle over hope.\n\n---\n\u003e Love it more with every new inch I discover. But you are a black boy, and you must be responsible for your body in a way that other boys cannot know. Indeed, you must be responsible for the worst actions of other black bodies, which, somehow, will always be assigned to you. And you must be responsible for the bodies of the powerful—the policeman who cracks you with a nightstick will quickly find his excuse in your furtive movements. And this is not reducible to just you—the women around you must be responsible for their bodies in a way that you never will know.\n\n---\n\u003e You have to make your peace with the chaos, but you cannot lie. You cannot forget how much they took from us and how they transfigured our very bodies into sugar, tobacco, cotton, and gold.\n\n---\n\u003e  I heard several people ask for forgiveness for the officer who’d shot Prince Jones down. I only vaguely recall my impressions of all this. But I know that I have always felt great distance from the grieving rituals of my people, and I must have felt it powerfully then. The need to forgive the officer would not have moved me, because even then, in some inchoate form, I knew that Prince was not killed by a single officer so much as he was murdered by his country and all the fears that have marked it from birth.\n\n---\n\u003e Perhaps you remember that time we went to see Howl’s Moving Castle on the Upper West Side. You were almost five years old. The theater was crowded, and when we came out we rode a set of escalators down to the ground floor. As we came off, you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, “Come on!” Many things now happened at once. There was the reaction of any parent when a stranger lays a hand on the body of his or her child. And there was my own insecurity in my ability to protect your black body. And more: There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action. But I was not out on my part of Flatbush. And I was not in West Baltimore. And I was far from The Mecca. I forgot all of that. I was only aware that someone had invoked their right over the body of my son. I turned and spoke to this woman, and my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history. She shrunk back, shocked. A white man standing nearby spoke up in her defense. I experienced this as his attempt to rescue the damsel from the beast. He had made no such attempt on behalf of my son. And he was now supported by other white people in the assembling crowd. The man came closer. He grew louder. I pushed him away. He said, “I could have you arrested!” I did not care. I told him this, and the desire to do much more was hot in my throat. This desire was only controllable because I remembered someone standing off to the side there, bearing witness to more fury than he had ever seen from me—you.\n\u003e I came home shook. It was a mix of shame for having gone back to the law of the streets mixed with rage—“I could have you arrested!” Which is to say: “I could take your body.”\n\n---\n\u003e The man ranted on. When the officers turned away, he ranted more to the group of black men assembled who’d been hired to sit his family out on the street. His manner was like all the powerless black people I’d ever known, exaggerating their bodies to conceal a fundamental plunder that they could not prevent.\n\n---\n\u003e A few weeks into our stay, I made a friend who wanted to improve his English as much as I wanted to improve my French. We met one day out in the crowd in front of Notre Dame. We walked to the Latin Quarter. We walked to a wine shop. Outside the wine shop there was seating. We sat and drank a bottle of red. We were served heaping piles of meats, bread, and cheese. Was this dinner? Did people do this? I had not even known how to imagine it. And more, was this all some elaborate ritual to get an angle on me? My friend paid. I thanked him. But when we left I made sure he walked out first. He wanted to show me one of those old buildings that seem to be around every corner in that city. And the entire time he was leading me, I was sure he was going to make a quick turn into an alley, where some dudes would be waiting to strip me of…what, exactly? But my new friend simply showed me the building, shook my hand, gave a fine bonne soirée, and walked off into the wide open night. And watching him walk away, I felt that I had missed part of the experience because of my eyes, because my eyes were made in Baltimore, because my eyes were blindfolded by fear.\n\n---\n\u003e I drove away from the house of Mable Jones thinking of all of this. I drove away, as always, thinking of you. I do not believe that we can stop them, Samori, because they must ultimately stop themselves.\n\n[[How can we be responsible pro-active citizens without becoming full-time activists]]\n\n---\n\u003e I saw these ghettos driving back from Dr. Jones’s home. They were the same ghettos I had seen in Chicago all those years ago, the same ghettos where my mother was raised, where my father was raised. Through the windshield I saw the mark of these ghettos—the abundance of beauty shops, churches, liquor stores, and crumbling housing—and I felt the old fear. Through the windshield I saw the rain coming down in sheets.\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- published:: 2015\n\t- read:: 2020-06\n\n---","snippets":["\u003e But race is the child of racism, not the father.

I propose to take our countrymen’s claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard.

I memorized a list of prohibited blocks. I learned the smell and feel of fighting weather. And I learned that “Shorty, can I see your bike?” was never a sincere question, and “Yo, you was messing with my cousin” was neither an earnest accusation nor a misunderstanding of the facts. These were the summonses that you answered with your left foot forward, your right foot back, your hands guarding your face, one slightly lower than the other, cocked like a hammer. Or they were answered by breaking out, ducking through alleys, cutting through backyards, then bounding through the door past your kid brother into your bedroom, pulling the tool out of your lambskin or from under your mattress or out of your Adidas shoebox, then calling up your own cousins (who really aren’t) and returning to that same block, on that same day, and to that same crew, hollering out, “Yeah, nigger, what’s up now?” I recall learning these laws clearer than I recall learning my colors and shapes, because these laws were essential to the security of my body.\n\n---\n\u003e A year after I watched the boy with the small eyes pull out a gun, my father beat me for letting another boy steal from me. Two years later, he beat me for threatening my ninth-grade teacher. Not being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out. I was a capable boy, intelligent, well-liked, but powerfully afraid. And I felt, vaguely, wordlessly, that for a child to be marked off for such a life, to be forced to live in fear was a great injustice. And what was the source of this fear? What was hiding behind the smoke screen of streets and schools? And what did it mean that number 2 pencils, conjugations without context, Pythagorean theorems, handshakes, and head nods were the difference between life and death, were the curtains drawing down between the world and me?\n\n---\n\u003e I took a survey of Europe post-1800.

Here are some personal thoughts on the strangeness of what we believe:\n\n- The Almagest shows our ability to force fit incorrect solutions, and then believe those solutions (ignoring the inconvenient parts).\n- The Almagest shows how we conflate _some_ truth with the _whole_ truth.\n- When reality disproves our beliefs, it’s easier to change the narrative protecting our beliefs, than to actually change our beliefs.\n- We just believe whatever we want to believe.\n\nIt makes me wonder:\n\n- What blind spots are we each living in right now?\n\n---\n\n👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵\n\nThe noise 🗑 is deafening.

O2 levels increase. CO2 levels decrease. pH levels increase (and surprisingly stay higher than what’s normal even after breath-holding, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe they are associated with pH drops.\n\nO2:CO2 Ratio \u0026 pH Levels:\n- A normal ratio is 4:1 \u0026 pH: 7.40\n- During hyperventilation, the ratio goes up to 11:1 \u0026 pH: 7.70\n- During hypoventilation, the ratio goes down to 1:1 \u0026 pH: 7.50\n\nInteresting note: Even after breath-holding, pH levels stay surprisingly higher than normal, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe the detriments that are talked about are always associated with drops in pH. Hence, if pH stays above normal, all should be good. I’d love to get some expert opinions on this.\n* [Research Link](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full)\n\nLactate Levels:\n- A normal range is 0.5 - 1.5 mmol/L. The test subject’s baseline was 0.70.\n- During hyperventilation, it only increased to 1.15 mmol/L.\n- During hypoventilation, it lowered to 0.90 mmol/L.\n\nFor comparison a 15-45 second sprint shows lactate levels rising way up to 8-15 mmol/L. So, there is no worry for the minuscule rise in lactate levels from hyper-hypoventilation.\n* [Research Link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2007391)\n\n### Benefit # 1: POSITIVE HORMONAL RESPONSE AND A (SUPPOSED) INCREASED IMMUNE SYSTEM.\nThis act stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline (just like taking a cold shower, which also forces us to hyperventilate a bit), and has been shown to benefit the immune system.\n\n### Benefit # 2: MINDFULNESS\nBoth conscious \"over-breathing\" and the conscious breath-holding act as a fast and simple form of mindfulness for me, getting me out of racing thoughts in the prefrontal cortex, and—due to the hormonal release—allowing my brain stem and more primitive parts of the brain (such as the pituitary gland) to activate without invoking worry and stress (I admit things get unclear for me here, so I'd like to hear more on this). Regardless, I’m more calm, centered, and clear-minded afterwards.\n\n### Benefit # 3: EUPHORIC FEELING\nBreathing in excess O2 leads to tingling fingers and lightheadedness. It also creates a slightly euphoric feeling.

They take them for a specific short-term (“just-in-time”) purpose—like a test or a project. When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. This type of note-taking doesn’t accumulate long-term value.\n\nNote-makers _“know and grow”_ with their knowledge. Instead of losing value, note-makers create **living notes** that are able to grow in value and evolve over time.\n\n### Properties of living, evergreen notes\nWhile evergreen notes are just regular notes, they have principles that generate value.\n\n- **Clear and concise** - The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement.\n    - As you form this one-liner, you clarify and sharpen your thinking. It’s like a mini-thesis. This process naturally enforces an atomic note size.\n    - Don’t stress about making notes \"atomic\". Follow the Goldilocks rule: Not too short, not too long.\n    - You will know if it’s too long if you have trouble linking it because it’s saying many different things.\n- **Own words** - Writing in your own words forces you to deeply think about what you’re trying to say.\n    - You will find this is a forcing function to naturally draw out your unique perspective.\n- **Linked** - Your living, evergreen notes should have links to other notes.\n    - You will naturally make links if you’ve made clear notes in your own words.\n- **Non-static** - As you encounter new things in life, you can re-write or re-factor your notes to capture more meaning and value.\n    - This means evergreen notes become living entities—gaining in insights and complexity as more time passes.\n\n### Benefits of note-making, linking your thinking, and evergreen notes\nCultivating a growing mass evergreen notes opens up a powerful way of connecting ideas and generating insights.\n\n- [[Note-making sharpens your thinking]]\n- [[Linking your thinking encourages leaps of insights]]\n- [[Note-making creates unexpected optionality]]\n\n---\n- [[Evergreen notes maximize reusability]]\n- [[Evergreen notes compound in value over time]]\n\nWant to make more of these kind of notes?

MOCs will help you overcome the overwhelming anxiety that can arise from having notes scattered everywhere.

Do you have trouble combining ideas? Are your notes scattered everywhere? Are you drowning in too much information? Have you lost the signal from the noise? If you answered yes to any of these, read on. \n\n*Q: I'm still reading...So, who benefits from having an Ideaverse?*\nA: People who write and think a lot. People who don't want to forget important ideas. People who develop ideas. People who value the ability to build upon their knowledge over years instead of letting it slip away to the ravages of time. \n\n*Q: Give me specific types of people please.*\nA: Students, academics, and life-long learners...makers, content creators, essay-writers...non-fiction and fiction writers...productivity and project-focused people...and life designers and anyone trying to live their best life. \n\n*Q: And what are ideas?* \nIdeas are solutions to problems. They are original creations or thoughts. They are new insights built on shoulders existing sources or previous work. With a dynamic ideaverse, you will finally be able to work rapidly and fluidly with ideas in ways that were previously not easy or even possible. A dynamic ideaverse holds real value for anyone who works with ideas. \n\n---\n*Q: Okay then...What is LYT?*\nA: LYT stands for \"Linking Your Thinking\". It is a proven framework for knowledge management based on using links to enhance your thinking. It articulates the theory of [[Idea Emergence (defn)]], and uses higher-order notes called \"Maps of Content\" (MOCs). See [[LYT Frameworks]].\n\nUse LYT to create your ideaverse. \n\n*Q: Is LYT the same thing as zettelkasten?*\nA: No. While many argue anything with linked notes written in your own words is a zettelkasten, the truth is that a zettelkasten has an extremely narrow focus: \"writing for output\". That's it. \n\nBut LYT is a framework that extends the vision, scope, and capability of a zettelkasten. It can be used for anything that requires thinking and writing. It is optimized for people to become the best sensemakers possible. And it provides new frameworks to accomplish this—especially Maps of Content.\n\nThe LYT method enhances how you write, think, and navigate with your ideaverse. \n\n---\n*Q: Please further explain this relationship between LYT and an Ideaverse.*\nA: Basically, the LYT frameworks are what give an ideaverse it's value. It provides flexible frameworks to allow your ideaverse to thrive for the rest of your life. Using LYT frameworks adds an optional layer to enhance writing, thinking, and navigating.\n\n---\n*Q: How does LYT help with writing, thinking, and navigating?*\nA: In several synergistic ways. Because it provides comforting, reliable navigation; it lowers anxiety. Because it's flexibility, it allows for non-rigid thinking. The list of benefits is deep. See [[Benefits of LYT frameworks]] \n\n---\n*Q: Do I need LYT?*\nA: No you don't, especially when you have less than a couple hundred notes. But you may want it. You'll know if you do. It's starts with a growing sense of anxiety and overwhelm...Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you'll find yourself gravitating toward a the creation of your first MOC, so you can work with several notes at the same time. See [[Is LYT For Me]].\n\n---\n*Q: What's an MOC?*\nA: An MOC stands for \"Map of Content\". MOCs may be the most important thinking tool you can use with your zettelkasten. [[MOCs Overview]]\n\n---\n*Q: How would you describe Maps of Content?*\nA: An MOC is just a note where you collect a bunch of related notes, then you stare at it, and think. The three core purposes to use an MOC for are to: gather, develop, and navigate ideas.\n\n---\n*Q: Aren't MOCs just another name for an index note?*\nWhile an MOC can act as a static index solely for navigation, its power comes from using it to gather, develop, collide, and refactor ideas.\n\nIn this way, MOCs become an entirely new tool for thinking in The Age of the Linked Note.","snippets":["*Q: What is an Ideaverse?*\nIt's the universe of ideas that exists between your brain and everything around it—but usually it refers to your digitally linked notes."],"rawContent":"---\nup:\n  - \"[[Ideaverse Map]]\"\nrelated: []\ncreated: 2020-06-01\n---\n\n- **So now I have to manage MOCs?**\n\t- Don't let the LYT, MOCs or anything become an \"I have to\" situation. You don't *have* to do anything. You don't have to make any map. Just go about your business of making notes for life. \n\t- The MOC will just hang out. You don't have to tend to it. There are no tasks to manage. You could never open your home note and MOCs for a whole year and they will be fine. Then on Day 366, if you click to them, they will be just as helpful. They are the big friendly giants of your ideaverse. \n\t- In this way, MOCs are basically just a bunch of stuff living on top of your notes. They should never get in the way of writing/creating—in fact, they should greatly *enhance* it.\n\t- See more: [[What can we learn from nerdy discussions on MOCs]]\n- **So how do I use the fluid frameworks in LYT on a daily basis?**\n\t- On a daily basis, you're just making notes, adding to notes, and not worried about having to structure things. Maybe you add a tag. Maybe a direct link to another note. That's it.\n\t- Don't worry about MOCs and the home note when you're doing basic writing and creation. You'll know when to make a new MOC because you start to feel a building sense of being overwhelmed. It happens when you have a lot of notes on a subject and need to structure the info.\n\t- The structuring is cool, but don't let the tail wag the dog :)\n- **What's the difference between an MOC and TOC? They seem interchangeable, am I missing something there?**\n\t- The distinction, which serves an important purpose, is an MOC doesn’t have to follow a linear format. It can be constantly reshuffled by you to meet your needs. It’s great for compiling topic-related ideas, notes, concepts.\n\t- Contrast that with a Table of Contents (TOC). It has one specific and linear order. A TOC should almost always find itself tied to a specific project. \n\t- So for a book project, you have the broad MOC (like a big work table with papers spread out everywhere); and you’d be building towards the specific, linear TOC, which would be the more traditional “section 2, chapter 1” or whatever.\n\t- On efforts and projects, I see the MOC and TOC as working in tandem more often than not.\n- **I've heard hierarchies and structures are bad.**\n\t- That can be true. But it's also not true.\n\t- Yes, a note buried deep in a series of cascading folders is harder to access. Folders act to limit a note's availability. They bury notes. This can be bad in that it reduces your potential *avenues towards note retrieval*. [^1] A note should be able to live freely and connect to as many notes as needed without restriction. \n\t- That's why MOCs (Maps of Content) are magicians: *they don't limit access; they curate it* (See [[Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea]]). MOCs exist in parallel with all your other notes. It's like having the ability to turn on an augmented overlay on top of your existing notes. They add context without constraint, freedom without friction. (Read more on MOCs at [[MOCs Overview]])\n- **How much friction will it take to manage this over time and how will it all fare if there are periods of time when I don't take the minimum amount of care to keep it updated?**\n\t- (@ryanjamurphy): There are “good” and “bad” kinds of knowledge management janitorial work. Good kinds involve discovering new insights and refining your knowledge, bad kinds involve distractions and degrade your work.\n\t- (@nickmilo): I can only speak from experience, but I have gone months without looking at my digital library, many times. That's actually why I craved and created the home note and MOCs: so I could immediately reconnect with my notes. Maybe it's a philosophy, but everything should just manage itself after it's set up. I don't think of it as extra tasks.\n\n\n---\n\n## What is LYT and an Ideaverse? \n\n*Q: What is an Ideaverse?*\nIt's the universe of ideas that exists between your brain and everything around it—but usually it refers to your digitally linked notes.\n\n*Q: Why should I care about an Ideaverse?*\nA: Do you want your notes to give you value, not just in the short-term, but forever?\nDo you lose ideas? Do you have trouble combining ideas? Are your notes scattered everywhere? Are you drowning in too much information? Have you lost the signal from the noise? If you answered yes to any of these, read on. \n\n*Q: I'm still reading...So, who benefits from having an Ideaverse?*\nA: People who write and think a lot. People who don't want to forget important ideas. People who develop ideas. People who value the ability to build upon their knowledge over years instead of letting it slip away to the ravages of time. \n\n*Q: Give me specific types of people please.*\nA: Students, academics, and life-long learners...makers, content creators, essay-writers...non-fiction and fiction writers...productivity and project-focused people...and life designers and anyone trying to live their best life. \n\n*Q: And what are ideas?* \nIdeas are solutions to problems. They are original creations or thoughts. They are new insights built on shoulders existing sources or previous work. With a dynamic ideaverse, you will finally be able to work rapidly and fluidly with ideas in ways that were previously not easy or even possible. A dynamic ideaverse holds real value for anyone who works with ideas. \n\n---\n*Q: Okay then...What is LYT?*\nA: LYT stands for \"Linking Your Thinking\". It is a proven framework for knowledge management based on using links to enhance your thinking. It articulates the theory of [[Idea Emergence (defn)]], and uses higher-order notes called \"Maps of Content\" (MOCs). See [[LYT Frameworks]].\n\nUse LYT to create your ideaverse. \n\n*Q: Is LYT the same thing as zettelkasten?*\nA: No. While many argue anything with linked notes written in your own words is a zettelkasten, the truth is that a zettelkasten has an extremely narrow focus: \"writing for output\". That's it. \n\nBut LYT is a framework that extends the vision, scope, and capability of a zettelkasten. It can be used for anything that requires thinking and writing. It is optimized for people to become the best sensemakers possible. And it provides new frameworks to accomplish this—especially Maps of Content.\n\nThe LYT method enhances how you write, think, and navigate with your ideaverse. \n\n---\n*Q: Please further explain this relationship between LYT and an Ideaverse.*\nA: Basically, the LYT frameworks are what give an ideaverse it's value. It provides flexible frameworks to allow your ideaverse to thrive for the rest of your life. Using LYT frameworks adds an optional layer to enhance writing, thinking, and navigating.\n\n---\n*Q: How does LYT help with writing, thinking, and navigating?*\nA: In several synergistic ways. Because it provides comforting, reliable navigation; it lowers anxiety. Because it's flexibility, it allows for non-rigid thinking. The list of benefits is deep. See [[Benefits of LYT frameworks]] \n\n---\n*Q: Do I need LYT?*\nA: No you don't, especially when you have less than a couple hundred notes. But you may want it. You'll know if you do. It's starts with a growing sense of anxiety and overwhelm...Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you'll find yourself gravitating toward a the creation of your first MOC, so you can work with several notes at the same time. See [[Is LYT For Me]].\n\n---\n*Q: What's an MOC?*\nA: An MOC stands for \"Map of Content\". MOCs may be the most important thinking tool you can use with your zettelkasten. [[MOCs Overview]]\n\n---\n*Q: How would you describe Maps of Content?*\nA: An MOC is just a note where you collect a bunch of related notes, then you stare at it, and think. The three core purposes to use an MOC for are to: gather, develop, and navigate ideas.\n\n---\n*Q: Aren't MOCs just another name for an index note?*\nWhile an MOC can act as a static index solely for navigation, its power comes from using it to gather, develop, collide, and refactor ideas.\n\nIn this way, MOCs become an entirely new tool for thinking in The Age of the Linked Note. \n","wordCount":1405,"tags":[],"metadata":{"created":"2020-06-01","related":[],"up":["[[Ideaverse Map]]"]},"created":"2025-05-22T16:13:20.220003715Z","modified":"2023-08-28T07:39:18Z","checksum":"090fd0a62c3de196be15afc60760f093f03c86bf3d6102d8ce0125a24de59ac2"},{"filename":"PKM Planet 1 - What is PKM.md","filenameStem":"PKM Planet 1 - What is PKM","path":"Atlas/Dots/Things/PKM Planet 1 - What is PKM.md","absPath":"/home/tjex/thesis/ideaverse-lite-1.5/Atlas/Dots/Things/PKM Planet 1 - What is PKM.md","title":"What is PKM","link":"[[Atlas/Dots/Things/PKM Planet 1 - What is PKM]]","lead":"## Intro\n### New intro\nPKM is a new term to describe an old problem: *how do we make sense of the world?*","body":"## Intro\n### New intro\nPKM is a new term to describe an old problem: *how do we make sense of the world?*\n\n- Maybe you're trying to get through history class...or write your dissertation for a PhD.\n- Maybe you've gone down the internet rabbit hole into some fascinating topic but don't want to forget everything by next week.\n- Maybe you're putting together a grocery list or a list of todos for the day.\n- Maybe you're working your way in a new career, trying to track who knows who, and how, and how that's relevant to your aspirations.\n- Maybe you just love ideas...and get inspired and blown away by how the plow—yes the plow—changed humanity (shout out to James Burke).\n- Maybe you want to track your dreams or your workouts, or heart rate over time. \n- Maybe you want to remember the memories you had with cherished friends and family, some of whom aren't around anymore—except in memory. \n- Maybe you want to figure out how to go about living a good life—something the Ancient Greeks might call it \"Eudaimonia\".\n\nIf you do anything like this, then you're managing knowledge.

How *do* we make sense of the world?* Now that's a thread that once you start pulling, it unravels all sorts of juicy questions. Questions like:\n\n\u003e What should I do in this world? How should I conduct myself? Where should I spend my limited amount of attention? What really matters? \n\nIf we decide these existential questions are fundamental to a \"life worth living\", then we better have a way of dealing with all the STUFF—you know, the intangible ether of ideas—the stuff that surrounds all of our waking, living, breathing moments.\n\n### Dealing with the stuff of ideas\nSo how do we deal with the stuff of ideas?\n\nWell, what did we do a few thousand years ago?\n\nOur ancient ancestors tried to manage knowledge so they could remember the most important stuff. In Buddhism, our ancestors codified knowledge into something called the 8-fold Path; not the 80-fold Path. Our Stoic ancestors had their 4 virtues, not 40. And at some point in time, basically all formal religions have taken a crack at phrasing the Golden Rule. \n\nThese things are easy to remember—let's call them reminders—and they act as helpful guide for us to at least strive to live a good life—whatever that means to each of us.\n\nWhoa, that's it! What does this stuff mean to us? What does it mean to you? How do you make sense of the world? And even if you think you have it all figured out today, how can you make sure you won't forget what you've learned. Because while life is too short, for our memories, it's too long. Believe me (I say to myself), the you of today isn't be the same you of 10 years ago, and it follows that the you of 10 years from today will have changed in equally big ways. Way bigger than we usually comprehend on a day to day basis. In that way, we give ourselves too much credit for what we'll remember. \n\nAnd there's the rub! I can't tell you how many times I had some amazing breakthrough on \"how to live a good life\", but quickly forgot it because I just kept consuming and collecting other ideas, until I drowned out the very idea that meant so much to me. That's bad PKM.\n\nThe reverse of that is good PKM. Instead collecting more idea-noise, stop for a bit and focus on the signal. Do something with it. With today's digital linking tools, you can easily connect that nugget of wisdom to an existing note in your knowledge library.  Boom! Now you've spent more time with it, you've externalized it, and you've connected it to other ideas. Now you've got a way of making sense of the world that can reliably grow with you over the years. Now 10 years from today, Future You can return to these notes and connect them to new experiences you've had. Or maybe Future You is having a mid-life crisis and having these notes can re-ground you and re-mind you of what brings you meaning.\n\nThat's some powerful ==Personal Knowledge Management==. \n\n%% \nHow can we intertwine what we learn and experience in the past—really important meaningful stuff—how can we intertwine that with the new situations and events we encounter? How can we actually practice, and get the reps in, with these most meaningful of concepts? \n\nThat's just one thing—one very important thing—that a PKM system can do for us. %% \n\n### End of intro transition (and CTA)\nSince there are so many ways to manage knowledge, it would be helpful to have a framework we can all point to. To that end, I'm excited to share the PKM Planet. The PKM Planet allows us to see *where* and think about *how* we are spending our time in the world of knowledge management.\n\n#### CTA 1 (newsletter)\nBy the way, if you're digging this content make sure to join the LYT Notes newsletter (the link is in the description (https://linkingyourthinking.com/lytnotes)). LYT notes focuses on:\n-   how to think better and with more joy\n-   and how to be a better *note-maker* instead of just a bolding note-taker\n\n---\n## PKM Planet\n### Using the PKM Planet to make sense everything we can do with PKM\nWelcome to the PKM Planet. On this planet, there are six main area/lands/realms where we spend time managing knowledge: Memory, Idea, Writing, Productivity, Skills, and Relationships. \n\n- **PMM** — *\"Memory Management\"* collecting knowledge, using \u0026 developing memory\n- **PIM** — *\"Idea Management\"* sense-making, connecting, \u0026 developing ideas\n- **PWM** — *\"Writing Management\"* writing, packaging, \u0026 sharing content\n- **PPM** — *\"Productivity Management\"* understanding, developing, \u0026 advancing projects \u0026 goals\n- **PSM** — \"*Skill Management\"*\n- improving \u0026 developing skills \u0026 abilities\n- **PRM** — *\"Relationship Management\"* understanding, developing, \u0026 maintaining relationships\n\nNow in practice, these areas often overlap: as you connect ideas you write about them, as you write about them you might be working towards a goal or advancing a project. That's why the PKM Planet is a blended color wheel filled with all shades under the sun.\n\nThe beauty of the PKM Planet is that it forces the question: *Where* am I spending time in my management of knowledge? And *how*?\n\nBecause the thing is, we only have a limited amount of time on this planet, so if we can bring more wisdom and intention to our knowledge management efforts, we can waste less time, get better results, and experience more joy in the process.\n\n\"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" — Gandalf ― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring \n\n#### CTA 2 (next videos in the series)\nUsing the PKM Planet, we can finally map out our use cases in a common way. We can more easily explain to people where we are spending our time in this hard to describe world of PKM. And it turns out, there are some common PKM archetypes. Knowing these archetypes better will help you \"Know Thyself\" better. The next seven videos in this \"What is PKM\" series will explore these archetypes. \n\n- How much time to you spend as a top-down thinker? How about as a bottom-up thinker. How can we map these archetypes on the PKM Planet.\n- How does the time spent with knowledge differ between Note-takers and Note-makers. What about Note-takers who get caught in a trap of progressive summarization? How does their quality of experience differ from note-makers?\n- How can we recognize the content regurgitators from the sense-makers? We can actually map their different weather patterns on the PKM Planet.\n- Are you a writer? A journaler? A fiction writer? A worldbuilder? How do those workflows map on the PKM Planet.\n- Are you a Personal Development Nerd? A project manager? Your time spent on the PKM Planet can be mapped to show a unified view of where you spend your thinking time.\n- Are you a student? What kind? A \"churn and burn\" student, or a \"know and grow\"? We'll explore the different goals and ocean currents on a student's PKM planet.\n- Maybe you want to keep track of a few people in your personal and professional life. What are the weather patterns on your PKM Planet?\n\nBefore we're done, we will detail over 14 PKM archetypes. Knowing these archetypes will help you avoid some of the most common pitfalls in knowledge management, while spending more time confidently saving, developing, and maturing your ideas, sustainably, over time.\n \n---\n## Conclusion\n### So, what is PKM? \n%% Bookend the intro, while tying into linking %% \nIf PKM could utter a single line, it would be this: *Through me, you make sense of the world.*\n\nThat's fundamentally important, because through your sense of the world, all your actions are influenced. \n\nThat means, through better sense-making, you become empowered to create better, learn faster, work at a higher and more sustainable level, *and yet*, stay grounded and focused as the world attempts to tear apart your attention.\n\nThrough better sense-making by digitally *linking your thinking*: you can develop your ideas over decades, you can make more valuable leaps of insights, and all the while, you can't help but train yourself into the habit of better thinking. By \"better thinking\", I mean ability to think  ==critically==, ==creatively==, and ==connectively==—all at the same time. \n\nThis type of sustainable sense-making will fill your thoughts with more joy, meaning, and personally unique perspectives. Armed with all of that, you can't help but be able to contribute more value in more ways to your family, your friends, your community, and society as a whole—and it's all from developing a personal environment to encourage, nurture, develop, and reliably save your best thinking.\n\nThat's the premise and the promise of a personal, knowledge management system.

MOCs **maintain their fluidity**: As opposed to folders, MOCs are nondestructive, non-restrictive, non-limiting perspectives. Unlike a folder, you are not forced to use them to access your notes. MOCs are “overlays” that add relevant information but that don't affect your base level notes. \n8. MOCs **allow for limitless flexibility**. Unlike folders or Table of Contents (TOC), MOCs are not hierarchical. They are [[Heterarchy|heterarchical]]. This means that different MOCs can map the same info in different ways, to fit whatever your current needs might be.\n9. MOCs **encourage \"Relational Positioning\"**: Don't argue with the Ancient Greeks and Romans about the [[Method of Loci|value of spatial relationships]].

Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\n\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\n\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007.

He led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,[4] and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]\n\nDespite his limitations on offense, as Russell averaged 15.1 points per game, his rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics' dominance during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\n\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\n\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[5] one of only four players to receive all three honors, and selected into the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor.[16] In 2021, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time for his coaching career.[17] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell's jersey number 6 league-wide, becoming the only player in NBA history to receive the honor.[18] ","wordCount":511,"tags":["people"],"metadata":{"created":"2020-06-01","dates":"1934 - 2022","related":[],"tags":["people"],"up":["[[People Map]]"]},"created":"2025-05-22T16:13:15.981908462Z","modified":"2023-08-28T07:49:32Z","checksum":"9c17d833e9b4a2b83c8b9b375eeadb2cc3eb8386f5e4faccdcf8a3f974ac3327"},{"filename":"Douglas R.

Can you elaborate on the René Girard reference? I would love to know how he did things\n\nThat is quite a task I'll try. Basically Girard \"discovered\" another facet of the human nature: that every desire is mimetic, or as the early version of the theory says: that there's a \"mimetic triangulation of desire\" where the mediator, who possesses the object of desire (with time) is to be hated/envied if he is close to the person who desires (like a friend, parent, etc), or admired if he is far (just like I admire Girard because I want \"his\" intelligence, theoretic capacity, etc). \n\nHe started observing this in literature, stating that there is a \"Romantic Lie\" in which the objects are desired for themselves, and a \"Novelistic Truth\" in which the triangulation is unveiled (Dostoievsky, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust...

But the triangular dynamic is still kept the same: you can strive to achieve the very same thing that you develop resentment towards to in the process.

TRIANGULATION! Here's how you can use it to unlock new insights in your PKM 👇\n\n\nWhat is \"triangulation?\" Triangulation is how we make sense of the world. We do it all the time! It's using two \"known points\" to find a third \"unknown point.\" Triangulation helps you: 1. UNDERSTAND 2. REMEMBER 3. \u0026 IMAGINE Now let me show you how they work...\n\n\nThe 1st Power of Triangulation: UNDERSTAND 📐 \nUse what you know to understand what you don't! For example, here are 3 (very simple) points: • you (known) • me (known) • idea (unknown) Your goal: Understand this idea → \"Pace Layers\"\n\n\nIf you don't know me... or the idea... you can't make a nice triangle. So you won't understand! If you know me better... you can use me as an anchor point to better understand Pace Layers. When you are clear on two points, you can better understand the third point.\n\n\nWe do this countless times a day! We triangulate to understand how things we *know* relate to things we *don't know.* Once you have a bunch of dots on your Map, you can UNDERSTAND things rapidly. But how do you REMEMBER all the dots?\n\n\nThe 2nd Power of Triangulation: REMEMBER 📐\nUse what you know to remember what you forgot! For example, let's say, you can't remember \"Pace Layers\". But you might remember the originator \"Steward Brand\" ([@stewartbrand](https://twitter.com/stewartbrand)). And from there, you'll remember \"Pace Layers.\"\n\n\nTriangulating to remember is how our brains naturally work. Try it out with your graph. Hover over one idea. What is it connected to? Over time, your ideas will have many links. And this is how we build powerful and personal Knowledge Networks.\n\n\nWhen you know two points, you can better remember a third point. Once you have a bunch of dots on your Map, you can REMEMBER things rapidly. But how do you create with the stuff you know?\n\n\nThe 3rd Power of Triangulation: IMAGINE 📐\nUse what you know to imagine new insights! This is the radical power of linking your thinking. By building your connective thinking muscle you become a creative machine.\n\n\nNow at the random crossroads between ideas, you are generating INSIGHTS! That means new forms of value. You are imagining worlds, products, and services. When you know two points, you can better imagine the third point.\n\n\nThese are the 3 triangulation powers to help think better than ever before! 1.

I say that with great love for personal development. I also say that as someone who read way too many books regurgitating the same concepts again and again. An occasional book every once in a while? Definitely. But if you're reading it because you think you don't already know how to set goals, then you might just be procrastinating. That's because there is a truth we don't honor in an aggressively productive society. Let's say it in different ways:\n\n\u003eYou already know what you need to know. You just need to do it.\n\n%%\n\n---\n\n- We approach what we don't know through the lens of what we do know. \n- We approach the unknown through the lens of the known. \n\n---\n\n### Example Alt Long\nWhether it's a forum post, youtube video, or Amazon review, why do we feel compelled to read the comments? Why is watching gamers comment about their gaming a multi-billion dollar industry? Because by consuming both the THING and the comments about the THING, we're making deeper sense of the THING (along with the person commenting about the THING). \n\nIn a world drowning in information overload, we crave quality curation.","snippets":["\u003e Triangulation is using two known points to find a third point."],"rawContent":"---\nup:\n  - \"[[MOCs Overview]]\"\ncreated: 2022-01-01\nrank: \"4\"\n---\n\n\u003e [!Box]- Outputs by date and location\n\u003e - #output/lesson 2022-02-01 - lesson retired\n\u003e - #output/twitter☑️ 2022-07-21 - [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1562063375491817473).\n\u003e - #output/youtube☑️ 2022-07-21 - [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV_7nppxv7A).\n\u003e - #output/newsletter 2022-07-26 - [newsletter](https://ckarchive.com/b/n4uohvh8xw94n).\n\u003e - #output/website 2022-xx-xx - website\n\n# Youtube script\n\u003e Triangulation is using two known points to find a third point. \n\nEvery version of sensemaking we do—every moment of every day—involves us triangulating information. \n\nTriangulation says *I am the ultimate sensemaking mechanism, to both the known and unknown.*\n\n**The three powers of triangulation**\n- You can use what you know to make sense of stuff.\n\t- Use two known points, to better understand a third point.\n- You can use what you know to remember old stuff.\n\t- Use two known points, to remember a forgotten third point.\n- You can use what you know to create new stuff.\n\t- Use two known points to imagine a third point.\n\n### Use two known points, to better understand a third point.\n![[feynman-triangulation-1.png]]\n\n\n### Use two known points, to remember a forgotten third point.\n![[feynman-triangulation-2.png]]\n\n### Use two known points to imagine a third point.\n![[feynman-triangulation-3.png]]\n\n**The third power of triangulation is basically [[Idea Emergence (defn)]]**. \n\nSo how does one improve their triangulation skills?

They won't all be built out at once.\n\n# Scratchpad\n- [[Triangulation]] - plenty I haven't covered above for the sake of brevity\n- [[Spatial Context]] - haven't mentioned, out of space\n- [[Method of Loci]] - haven't mentioned, out of space\n- (Naturally leads to the next lesson, which covers 🥾Stronger tethers, Better Recall)\n- Reminders \u0026 Insights \u0026 Triangulation: What Idea Emergence gives us (Unit 6) - Triangulation (Feynman)\n\n---\n\n\u003e “I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” - Mark Twain\n\nWhen it comes to \"triangulation\", I could write a really long letter. ✉️ But for the workshop, I want to honor your valuable attention, so here is the short version...\n\n\n---\n\u003e Many of the best ideas are the ones we've already had—we just need the reminder.\n\n%% Don't like this here\nThis is also known as the \"You just finished reading a self-help book, please don't immediately read another one\" Rule. I say that with great love for personal development. I also say that as someone who read way too many books regurgitating the same concepts again and again. An occasional book every once in a while? Definitely. But if you're reading it because you think you don't already know how to set goals, then you might just be procrastinating. That's because there is a truth we don't honor in an aggressively productive society. Let's say it in different ways:\n\n\u003eYou already know what you need to know. You just need to do it.\n\n%%\n\n---\n\n- We approach what we don't know through the lens of what we do know. \n- We approach the unknown through the lens of the known. \n\n---\n\n### Example Alt Long\nWhether it's a forum post, youtube video, or Amazon review, why do we feel compelled to read the comments? Why is watching gamers comment about their gaming a multi-billion dollar industry? Because by consuming both the THING and the comments about the THING, we're making deeper sense of the THING (along with the person commenting about the THING). \n\nIn a world drowning in information overload, we crave quality curation.\n\n\n","wordCount":2293,"tags":["output/lesson","output/twitter","output/youtube","output/newsletter","output/website"],"metadata":{"created":"2022-01-01","rank":"4","up":["[[MOCs Overview]]"]},"created":"2025-05-22T16:13:16.748256605Z","modified":"2023-08-28T14:24:16Z","checksum":"225cd95a524a17e2eeace99a4a0c29708232ae266dcdb009ea4de8cbd728c187"}]
